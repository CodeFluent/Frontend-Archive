--Autobiography--

In the bright sunny day in the busy town of Los Angeles called Little Tokyo, which is a Japanese town a second child was born to a (sic) proud parents of Mr. & Mrs. Horiguchi on November 30, 1925.  When I was born I was named after my grandmother as Nagako Horiguchi.  When I was born we lived in Pasadena, California.
	My father then owned a fruit stand and worked there everyday (sic).  My mother stayed at home all day and kept the house while she took care of me in a buggy.  I was said from my mother that when I was small I was really quiet, but mean and always stuck my thumb in the buggy.  As I was old enough and was able to walk around and go outside to play with my friends I was really said to be a mean girl and always started to pick a fight on my friends and would always win and would come home running after I made my friends cry.  When I got home my mother used to get mad at me and would spank me and tell me not to be mean, but be nice as all other little girls do.  I had lots of toys to play with, but my older brother would get hold of it and break it up.  I did not have any pets to play with cause I was said that I was always afraid of them and never liked them.
	There are eight members in our family.  We have 3 boys, 2 girls, grandfather, mother and a father all of them whom are still in the best of health and living happily in this camp.  Our religion is Buddah (sic).
	When I was six years old I attended Perry Elementary School and also graduated there in the year of 1940.  After I graduated grammar school I attended Redondo Union High School which was in the city of Redondo Beach, California.  I liked High School more than I did grammar school cause I had more fun there but one thing I didn’t like about being in High School was because they gave me lots of homework to do, but I (sic) I’m now use to of it now and is expecting to get a lot of it cause I’m now in High School and not being in Grammar School anymore for them days are gone forever.  The subject I like best of all is Gym and Clothing.  It’s because I’m good in Gym and also in Clothing and because I’m interested in these courses.  Since I was in High School I did not make much accomplishment but little in English.  The most improvement I’ve made up to now is in sewing.
	I’m interested in talents, clubs, sports, and church, too, but I’m not in any of the gangs.  In sports I like baseball and volleyball the best in talents singing and dancing, in clubs I’ve only been in one of them which was when I was in school called the Japanese Club, and found it to be interested so I am now in the club of my block.  I’m also interested in hobbies which few of them are collecting movie stars and listening to the radio.
	In amusements I like movies, radio, social gathering, and little in reading which are novels and movie magazine.  The best of them I like is movies, which I sure do miss a lot and haven’t seen it for three or four months or so since we came into this camp.
	When I was living in California I used to help my parents on a vegetable farm when I came home from school.  On summer vacation I also helped on the farm picking vegetables.
	I did not travel much cause (sic) we were a farmer and did not have time to travel.  The only place I traveled to was to San Francisco and to the mountains to see snow cause (sic) we never saw it before.  This was in the year of 1937.
	When the war broke out in the year of 1941 and three or four months later I read in the paper that the Japanese people living near the Pacific coast must be evacuated.  When I heard this I didn’t like it cause it meant that I have to leave school, my friends I knew in school, and also my home which I lived in it for 14 years in the same place.  About one month later when we got are (sic) notice that it was our turn to evacuate next I went to school that next day and quitted it.  I dropped school cause I couldn’t think or study for my mind was on about us going to be evacuated and be sent to some far place where we wouldn’t be near the from the coast.  My mother and father was also worried about this situation and didn’t like about quitting the farm business but thought it was the best to do so he had to quit the farm.  The next day he got a notice to come to register to Loundale  to get information abouting (sic) evacuating.  When he went there they took his name and asked how many members there were in our family and gave him a tag with the family number on it to be put on the baggages (sic), and an identification number to be put on each person so they’’ll know who you are when your being evacuated.  Also they told him the things which he should not take with him.  They told him he could take only suitcases and little of your belongings and etc (sic) just so you don’t have much.  When he came home and told us about it we knew we didn’t have enough suitcases to pack are (sic) clothes in so we hurried to Los Angeles to buy few more suitcases.  The next day my mother and I hurried and pack our clothes in the suitcases, while my father took the furnitures (sic), dishes, books, and many other things to our neighbors place to have it stored until we come back. The day for us to evacuate has finally come which was on the date of April 4,1942.  We got up early that morning cause we were told to be there at Loundale at 7:00 a.m.  The day we were evacuated was a very rainy day and we had a hard time keeping our baggages (sic) from getting wet.  We waited at Loundale for about two hours before we got started.  When we left Loundale it was 9 o’clock and when we started moving I felt very sad and felt like crying cause I sure did hated to leave that place that morning.  We all droved (sic) in a single line while the Army trucks watched us from both sides to see if anything doesn’t happen to us on the way.  We drove really slow that day especially cause it was raining hard that day.  Around 12 o’clock I was really tired doing nothing but sitting in the car and looking out from the window.  Before long I’ve noticed that a signed (sic) read as Santa Anita was seen and I was really glad that we reached our destination safely and before it was dark.  It was 12:30 when we reached this place and we missed our noon meal that day.  One thing I just didn’t like about it when I reached that day was when we were told to live in the horse stables I didn’t like this room cause I felt as though I was a horse being put in a stable and the other thing was because it smelled  awful in there.  After about a week I got use to of this place and I liked it and felt more like being in a regular house.  The first night I slept in this house I just couldn’t sleep cause I was homesick and wasn’t use to of this room.  The next day I woke up feeling fine as usual and was through worrying about being evacuated.

Autobiography

	Out in the canyons of Culver City, California stood a lonely house all by itself.  The house was surrounded with beautiful flowers.
It was in Culver City where I was born early in the morning of January 30, 1927.  Culver City at that time was quite a big city, but the roads were nothing but of dirt.  But now if one traveled there it would be like going to a strange place,  Yes, the place where I was born is now a golf field, sand the roads that was once nothing but dirt is now all paved, and to think there is a big motion picture studio there.
	At that time my fathers (sic) occupation was a florist.   He worked hard from morning to night, raising different types of flowers.  Early in the morning he would get up and take the flowers to the Southern California Market of Los Angeles to sell.  My mother also worked out in the ranch.  For two years after my birth we stayed in Culver City, then our whole family left for Japan on a vacation tour to visit my grandmother.
	After reaching Japan I was overcomed (sic) by a serious illness.  My illness started from the apex of a lung and ended up with the pleura.  I was then forced to have a portion of my rib removed.  Day and night my parents looked after me.  It it wasn’t for them who took great care of me, I don’t know what would of happened to me.  Thanks to them I’m still living, with a portion of my rib removed.  Because of my illness we delayed in returning to the United States.  After I was completely recovered we began to return to the United States, leaving my brother and sister behind in the care of my lonely grandmother.  That was in the year of 1930.
	After arriving to the United States we set up a home in Manhattan Beach, California, where my father began to raise flowers again.
	My only playmates at that time was (sic) a couple of good Mexican children.  I played with them from morning till night.  Their parents were of good nature and I enjoyed them very much.  As the years went by I began to talk to them in Spanish.  Although I didn’t speak very well they understood me, and in return they answered.
	At the age of six I started school.  The school was located one mile from our home.  Every day I went to school with my Mexican neighbors.  The name of the school was Grant School.  The building was two stories high.  I enjoyed going to school and I made a lot of friends that I can never forget in my mind.  As I grew older I began to play with the Caucasians, and I had a very good friend which I played with all the time.  While attending Grant, in the year 1934 there was a terrific earthquake damaging our school building very badly.  We then started to go to school in tents for almost two and a half year.  At the end of two and a half years we had the privilege of going to a new building.  The school was now a one story one, and designed very modernly.
	As I grew older I began to work, helping my parents out in the field, after school.  At that time my pet was a small collie dog which I took care of before its eyes were even open.  I loved to play with him, even now I wish he was with me.
	While living in Manhattan my sister and brothers returned from Japan.  When I saw them at first, it brought tears to my eyes, and joy to my heart.
	In the year of 1937 we moved to Torrance, California about seven miles from Manhattan Beach.  On the west of our house there was a great big steel company called “Colombia Steel”.  It operated from day and night, and the furnace were burning and we heard the engine of the locomotive as it took steel to the different sections of the factory.  And north to us there was a refinery company, and facing east there was a Pacific Electric Company.  Torrance was sometimes called “The Balanced City”.  They probably named it the Balanced City because it had so many stores and factorys (sic) to make it balanced.
While in Torrance I continued going to school.  I was greatly interested in taking sport pictures with my camera.  While going to school and participating in varies (sic) sports I took a great many sport pictures.  Of the best pictures I took, I had them put in the school annual.  I participated in basketball and track.
In my spare time I usually listened to the radio.  Of all the radio programs I loved to hear the quiz programs.  I usually tried to answer the question before the contestant and once in a while I got the correct answer.
While going to high school the most tragic of all my life happened.  Yes, it was the war between America and Japan.  I went to school everyday (sic) until the time for the evacuation.  Even after the war broke out the students were very good to us.  Then came the time for evacuation, we sold most of our properties and stored a lot of properties too.  When I had to separate from my friends it brought tears to my eyes.  Right before evacuation one of my teachers came to my house to say good bye.  Even now she writes to me, and she tells me of what is happening out at our high school
From April 13, 1942 to September 26, 1942 I was in the Santa Anita Assembly Center living in the horse stables.  While in Santa Anita I worked as a waiter in a big mess hall which was located under the grandstand.
Then came the day for us to evacuate once more to the inland.  It just so happened that I was relocated to Rohwer Relocation Center, Arkansas.  On the way up here we passed through many states.  From morning to night I gazed out the window and saw the beautiful scenery.
After arriving here I tried to adjust myself to the environment up here in Arkansas but it is pretty had to really get us (sic) to the climate.  Up to now I tried to make myself as happy as I could be by making a lot of new friends.

An Autobiography of Myself

	As much as I can recall of my childhood days are that which is told by my parents.  I, Marian Yamamoto was born in Long Beach, California.  The second child and first daughter of Mr. & Mrs. Lakichi Yamamoto.  On February 15th, 1926; I came to earth, believe it or not born alive, after two hours of stillness and silence.  I came to life with a yelling that could of woken the dead.
	Remembering very little of my childhood days I must of did lot of traveling in those early day of life.  At one, we moved from Long Beach to Santa Maria, where my parents worked on a farm.  Living there for a short while, we then moved to the ritzy place of Hollywood.  At the age of three we landed in the stinking fish harbor, in Terminal Island, California.
	Here was the place I spent the great percent of my life till evacuation came up.  Father occupation was fisherman and Mother a cannery worker.  The period of my childhood days was no different from any other girl of that age.  I was very fond of dolls and most of my time was spent in playing house and playing with my older brother Yoskiaki.  I was blessed with good health and hardly did I ever become ill.  There are six of us in our family now and quite a large family.  Two brothers, younger and older, one younger sister, Mother, Father and I.
	School began for me when I was six years of age, just like any typical American girl.  I started to learn the three R’s (Reading, ‘Riting and ‘Rithmatic).  During the grammar school, l was taught many of the fundamental things which are of much assistance to me now.  One hard time I had during my grammar school days was drinking milk.  I sure did dislike milk.  Even now, I can’t drink milk. 
	My classmates and friends were mostly Japanese, until I enter Richard Henry Dana Jr. High School.  From there on I learn to enjoy the companionship of the Caucasion (sic) peoples.  I studied hard in Jr. High School and took interest in the business course that was offered.  Typing and working as a secretary to one of the teacher in Dana were some of my favorite subjects.
	I also loved to sew and knit during my spare time.  My hobby was tap dancing.  I went to dancing school, ever since when I was nine years of age.  I had a chance of dancing for school assemblies.
	After graduating Dana I entered San Pedro High School.  Words cannot express my feeling of gladness as I was enrolled in one of the newest and one of the modern school in Los Angeles district.
	Life at school was happy and merry for me.  I enjoyed my friendship with all different nationality.  We were treated and felt as one of them.  I enjoyed going to movies with my school friends.  Was very interested in joining clubs, social gathering and especially listening to the radio (sic).  One of the most happiest (sic) moments were playing all different kind of sports with all types of girls at school.  Baseball and basketball were my favorite sports.  Everything seemed to be rolling on merrily.
	Then came the fateful December 7th, war!  At that time it seemed unbelievable.  My country was fighting with Japan, the homeland of my parents.  Many Japanese students then quit school, but I still kept on going to school.
	One day a notice of all Japanese, citizen or non-citizen, were to evacuate from Terminal Island within forty eight hours, then I had to quit school and that bit me harder and had more effect upon me than anything in my life.  Father was taken away by the F.B.I.’s.  We lost money and left most of our furniture laying (sic) down on the floor.
	We then moved to Los Angeles to our friends (sic) hotel.  Never did I feel so shocked and stunned from such unpleasant news. How I hated to part with my friends and relatives.
	Here at Los Angeles, I spend two month at the hotel, while staying there I attended Belmont High School and some of my friends went there too.  From that day on, step by step plans and order were made, which affected us, until at last it leaded into evacuation of all Japanese citizen or non-citizen into relocation camp and assembly centers.
	On May 6, 1942 we were thrown into the horse stable of Santa Anita.  During my days at Santa Anita, I have learned many great deals of things.  I made new friends, had a opportunity of improving my tap-dancing and learned to go to church and Sunday School every Sunday.   I also had the great pleasure of teaching tap-dancing.  Father came back from camp.
	Days pasted (sic) by fast in Santa Anita.  Time came for us to evacuated to relocation center.  This was the order by the W.C.C.A.  For the first time in my life I took a long trip on a train.  It was very uncomfortable on the train and sure tire-some.  At night there were four of us sleeping together on the seat.  We came through Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana and then to relocation center in Arkansas.  It was first time I ever went out of California.  This camp was million times better than I expected.  We all are glad we came here.
	This will be my home till this mess is over and hope it will be over soon.  I know I’ll get used to Arkansas like I was at California.  Our family our (sic) all together now and we’re getting along just fine.

My Autobiography

	I came into this world at five P.M., November 29, 1926, at a little apartment house situated in the southern part of Sacramento City in Sacramento County, California.  It is now known as the capital of California although it is not the largest city in that state.  The Suttor’s Fort in Sacramento gives you an idea of how frontiersmen protected themselves in the earlier days.
	The first three four years of my childhood was spent in that city and then we moved out to a farm.  During that time my little sister came into this life so I had a big sister and a little sister.  This farm was located far from anybody and I played with my older sister or toys, and amused myself with the baby.  I went to town many times with my father when he went on errands.  We had a green old-fashioned car.
	While my father was farming my mother guided us, showing us the good from bad, how to play with dolls, made our clothes, cooked, and did what every mother would and should do for her children.  Then another baby, a boy this time, was borne in October 3, 1930, at the same place as I.  This made six in the family, three girls, one boy, and two parents.
	Then two years later we moved to another farm where my second brother and the baby of the family was born.  Previously we had not been going to church because we lived so far from it but we moved to a better surrounding so we started toing to the Christian Church.  My parents are Buhhist (sic)  but (since) we went to Christian Church since it was much closer and mother wanted us to go to any kind of church just as long as we went.  Father raided strawberries, grapes, vegetables, and chickens.  I learned to skate then for we lived near a gravel road.
	We moved again to another farm close by the center of a little town named Florin.  This time we went to Buddhist Church and I started school when I was seven.  It was a small school where only Japanese children went.  There was another school where the other races went but I heard recently, before the war, that these two schools were combined into one.  There were only Japanese students to talk to so we more or less talked in our native tongue which the teachers had a tough time correcting.  My favorite subjects then were arithmetic, reading, and art although I didn’t dislike any particular quarter.
	Three years later when I was in the high fourth a great blow came on my mother and her children which probably changed our course in life.  Within a week after my father took to bed with pneumonia he passed away.  My mother was working in the city during the last year or so and we were living with our father in the country.  My mother could not manage the farm and she had to work to support five growing children so her immediate right after the funeral was to find a place in the city for us to live in.  One week later we found ourselves in our birth town, where mother was working at a restaurant.  That was in the year 1937.
	I went to Lincoln School and skipped half a grade because my knowledge in arithmetic was half a year ahead of the rest of the class.  What a difference to associate with other nationalities besides Japanese.  I felt out of place although everybody treated me nice.  We stayed in that city for one year and one month, and moved this time to Stockton, California because of mother’s occupation.  Then I really came to know and make friends with people outside my race.  They were all wonderful.  I went to Buddhist Church every Sunday, and I also learned many slang expressions, began to understand how gossip started, and why people avoid gossipers.  Besides going to American school I also went to Japanese school after school hours.
	Do I have any special talent?  No, so I enjoy listening and seeing other people’s talents.  I especially like to see talented artists’ work.  I was in a Basketball team during the last year I was there and it was a lot of fun besides developing my body.  Clubs were for people older than I, and I didn’t go in gangs but I have several good friends.  I love sports, especially basketball, tennis, ping-pong, archery, volleyball, and softball.  I would like to learn how to play hockey and badmington (sic).
	My favorite studies now are Spanish, Mathematics, Reading, and Business subjects.
	Collecting stamps and match covers were my hobbies buy at present I do not have any hobby.  Do I like movies?  I used to go almost every Sunday and I wish I could go now.  I love to listen to radios but we haven’t got any.  It’s such a pleasant way to spend your time.  We had a big one which could be used for phonograph playing too so I miss it more.  Social gathering is not in my line but I do go to socials now and then.  I love reading.  When I was in Stockton I brought home six to fourteen books a week.
	I used to spend two or three weeks at the city, where mother was rooming, for my vacation when I was in Florin.  During my stay at Stockton I went to Santa Cruz once but the rest of the summers were spent at home reading, playing, or helping around the house.
	About a year ago when United States went into war I started hearing rumors about evacuation concerning people living near the coast.  We lived close to the coast but I thought it was only for those living in San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, etc. whose cities are located just next to the ocean.  But as weeks went by we were included too.  Now came the problem of what to bring to camp.  Mother was not well because she had been working too hard during the last five years.  She had to face another big responsibility.  April and May were busy months.  Shopping awaited us whenever there was time.  Materials were bought for making clothes and we had to hunt for suitcases.  Besides helping mother get ready I had my studies to do.  Temptations to play with my friends were great but being the second oldest I had to help.  I transferred out of school on Friday, May 8th, two days before evacuation.  We left with the voluntary group and reached our temporary center, the County Fair Grounds at one P.M. on Tuesday.  Then came the daily routine of camp life.  Meals at certain times, frequent talent shows, sand sports were some of them.  I went to summer school from June to October.  On hot nights my friends and I used to go wandering around the camp or take a walk around the track.  This center was a small place, containing ten blocks with a canteen, grandstand, hospital, barber shop, library, and ware houses.
	The things that majority of us enjoyed were movies although they weren’t up to date, and free coupon books.
	Tulelake Lake, Arizona, or Manzanas were first guesses of our relocation center.  Then it became Colorado or Wyoming and finally Arkansas.
	After staying five months in the Stockton Center we had to move again.  The work was much simpler because we didn’t have to sort out what to bring or what not to bring.  We brought everything.
	We were the first to enter camp and the last to leave.  We left our center on October 17th, 1942 and arrived in Rohwer on October 21st, 1942.  Our trip on the train was wonderful.  The states that we passed were Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.  Many evacuees bought home made (sic) souvenirs from native Indian women the train stopped ay Yuma, Arizona.  Texas had beautiful scenery and I was surprised because I didn’t expect it.  Some of the well know rivers we saw were Colorado River, Rio Grande, and Red River.
	It looks as if we have been through a lot although I am sure that we still have to endure more hardships later on than people would under ordinary circumstances.  This camp life is good experience for us because it teaches you how to cooperate and what each and every one of us must do to make everybody happy under difficult  conditions.

Autobiography

	I was born in the beautiful old city of Salt Lake, on May 12, 1925.  I am told my father was exceeding happy on that particular May morning, because a son was born to him.  Like all Japanese people this was surely a great event, for it is every Japanese father’s desire to have a son carry on the family name.
	My father had a jewelry store in Salt Lake City, but when I was about three years old our family moved out to Los Angeles, California.  There he started to sell life insurance.  My mother devoted all her time and attention to our well being.  She was always telling us what to do and what not to do.  I think her technique was swell.  Whenever we wanted to do something she did not approve of, she would say, “Do it if you like, I will not stop you, if you think it’s right.”  This always made us think twice and nine times out of ten we didn’t do it.
	We lived in the western part of Los Angeles, right near the University of Southern California (U.S.C.).  I think my childhood was an happy one, for I had a older sister and a younger brother who is two years younger than me.  In this particular neighborhood there were many Japanese familys (sic), so there were many playmates with whom I went to the 37th Grammar School.  We also had a couple of dogs for pets.  I remember one particular dog, who used to follow me to school every-day.  He was a little black and white dog who we used to call, “Blackie”.  There was another little boston bull I used to play with.  We called him “Chico” and he was an very intelligent dog.  We loved this dog because he will never eat anything we have in our hands.
	When I was in the forth (sic) grade my father thought it was about time we were sent to Japan to see what kind of a country it is.  So on March, 1934, with my mother we left for Japan!.  Boy!  The trip over was nice.  We stopped at San Francisco and Hawaii.  The trip took 14 days and every minuet (sic) of it was a pleasure.  We had parties and saw movies on the liner.   We stayed in Japan for 22 months, traveling from one historical place to another, looking at historical shrines and castles.  Japan wasn’t a bad place but I’m not sure whether I would want to live there.  We finally left Japan on Oct. 1935.  As we were coming into the Golden Gate, we saw the foundations for the future Golden Gate Bridge.  I enjoyed my trip to Japan but I was glad to get home.  It is interesting to know that, although I was in Japan for 22 short months, I forgot how to speak the English language.  So I had to start all over when I came back.
	After my trip we moved to the eastern part of Los 
Angeles.  There I attended the Malabar St. School.  Later I went to Belvedere Junior High School, where I took an academic course.  I always loved mathematics, so I took it whenever possible.  I also enjoy learning about mechanical things like gas and diesel engines.  I plan to attend a trade school after my time is up there.
	As a small boy I always loved to read books.  I was what they call a “Book Worm” until a few years ago, when my eyes started to get bad.  When I found this out, I had to stop reading.  After this I turned to listening to the radio during my spare moments.  I also love to see movies and this is one of the things I miss most in this camp.  Another thing I miss is the various clubs I used to belong to back in Los Angeles.  We used to go on week-end hikes and explore the mountain ranges or deserts around Los Angeles.  I hope such clubs will form at school so we can to hiking in the surrounding woods.
	Most of my summer vacations were spent at the beach, but sometimes we went on motor trips to Yosemity (sic) National Park or some other interesting places like, Boulder Dam, Santa Barbara, San Diego and San Francisco.
	When this war started and all the Japanese people, alien and a citizen, were ordered off the Pacific coast it was a shock to me.  There I was, just out of eighth grade, where I was taught that the constitution guarded all the rights of its citizens.  I had to forget all that was taught to me about our democratic country.  I cannot put into words the feeling I had; when we had to sell our furniture.  To see another man, smiling drive our new car away, forever!  When we had to line up, in front of hundreds of onlookers on buses which took us to the concentration camp, which was located in Arcadia, California.  When I first sat down to eat at a long wooden table with thousands of other evacuees.  I saw some people with tears in their eyes as they started to eat the pour meal, out of metal plates.  I guess they all felt like I did for they hardly touched their plates and kept their head bend down.  This was the first meal.  Later they seem to act used to eating with thousands of other people, for they started to talk to friends across the table and beside them.
	After 3 months of communal life in Arcadia, California, we were sent to Rohwer, Arkansas, where I am staying at the present.  I hope in the near future we will be able to go outside and lead a life like we used to in Los Angeles, to lead a life like any other red-blooded American.

Autobiography

	I was born on December 4, 1927 in Alameda, California,  a comparatively small city of about 40,000 inhabitants.  Alameda is a sister city of Oakland and Berkeley and a suburb of San Francisco.  My entire life, save for the past year, has been spent in that city.
	My childhood was a happy one.  Mother worked, and therefore in my pre-kindergarten days, I was left for the most part, to the care of a neighbor.  There were eight members in our family then; Father, Mother, my three older sisters, an older and a younger brother and I.  Times were hard, but we were happy, so what cared we.
	In those days, Father was a gardener and Mother, despite the little knowledge of English she possessed, worked hard and long as domestic help.  She had little time to spend with us, her children, but what little she had she utilized by teaching us those principles which all mothers hold as their duties to teach to their children.  She taught us honesty and kindness and love and devotion as well as the precepts of her religion, Buddhism.
	I attended an eight year grammar school, Porter School, and was graduated after seven years in January, 1941.  Meanwhile, Father had passed away and Mother had given up her job to care for her family at home.  Graduation from elementary school is an event which I fondly look back upon because it was then that the Eighth Grade, proudly and with much blush and ado, donned their first pairs on long hose, received their first corsages and attended their first “big” dance.  Those were welcome signs of growing up, and you may well imagine how gladly we received them.
	High school, then, was our next step in our road of education.  Alameda has but one high school, Alameda High, which boasts of an enrollment of approximately two thousand students.  I had looked forward to attending high school throughout the latter half of my grammar school years, nor was I disappointed in my hopes.  High school to me meant study and examinations and football games and student body meetings but more than that a realization that I had really grown up, physically, mentally and emotionally.  I spent nine blissful months at Alameda High and in November, 1941 moved away from home across the Bay to San Francisco.
	Life in a new city was, for the most part, lonely and bewildering.  Hitherto, I had lived a sheltered life in a small community, encompassed by friends and familiar faces.  How perplexed and at a loss was I to suddenly find myself in a strange city without a person whom I could call a friend.
	The bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on that Sunday in December came as a distinct shock to most of us.  Our family, stunned and disbelieving, huddled about the radio to hear the various news reports.  We feebly attempted to toss off the attack as a mere hoax, but six inch headlines screaming “WAR!” could not lie.  We were forced to face reality.
	Rumours of evacuation filled the air soon after December 7, but it was not until the latter part of February when all Japanese aliens were evacuated from the city of Alameda that we gave serious consideration and thought to the rumour.  Alameda with its Naval Air Base, shipyards, Coast Guard Base and airports had overnight undergone a complete change from a quiet, peaceful residential city to a thriving, booming defense town!
	Manzanar Relocation Center in southern California was opened in March, and on April 2 we who lived in northern San Francisco received our notices to be evacuated to Santa Anita Assembly Center on the evening of the 6th.  The four days between the receipt of our notice and the actual day of evacuation were four hectic days of excitement and anxiety.  We rushed helter-skelter into our packing and bewildered and confused scurried about in a vague and absent minded daze.  It was with a sigh of genuine relief that we sank into our seats in the train that was to take us down to southern California.
	The memories which I shall cherish most and which will cling to me in later years are those of the days and events at Santa Anita.  Here in an entirely new environment, we spent six happy months overshadowed only by war and the circumstances which lead us into an assembly center.  My experiences at Santa Anita were many and varied.  I can now say that I have lived in a stable, met more friends in six all too short months than I have ever met in my life, studied in the Grandstand of one of the world’s most beautiful race tracks, eaten beans, beans and more beans and witnessed strikes and mob violence.  Yes, life at Santa Anita was fun, but it was that sort of fun which I would not like to live over again and yet which I would not have missed for anything in this world.
	We were relocated to Rohwer Relocation Center on October 6, 1942.  The friends whom I met at Santa Anita are now scattered in relocation centers throughout the United States.  I have few friends with whom I am intimately acquainted in this center at present, but since the opportunities for friendship here are endless, I am quite sure that I will be able to adapt myself socially very quickly.  My leisure hours are particularly occupied by reading and by sports.   Collegiate football, basketball and track are my favorite sports as a spectator and as a listener.  I am an avid fan of the university which I hope someday to attend, the University of California at Berkeley.
	For us, the future is brighter, now more than ever before.  Relocation is a challenge, one which will not be easy to conquer.  But let us hope that it will not be long before each and every evacuee is relocated and rehabilitated in some community where he can earn an honest living without fear of discrimination.

THE STORY OF MY LIFE

	Seventeen years ago I was born, the third child of Mr. and Mrs. Kobayashi, in a small town called Arthur, Utah, about thirty five miles from Salt Lake City.  Our stay in this town was not very long for we then moved on into Salt Lake City.  After my little brother was born and I became the proud age of three, we moved out to California, leaving behind us a few happy years in Utah.
	Soon we arrived at our destination – a small, city named Montebello, about nine miles from Los Angeles.  The first person we met on California soil, was Ann Tsuji’s parent, who aided us in finding our future home.
	Before coming to California, my father worked in a smelting company and then for a few years became a lettuce farmer.  I could remember so distinctly the acres and acres of the green lettuce patch.  In Montebello he worked for a good friend of our’s (sic) as a gardener.  This job he kept until evacuation.
	My mother will always be in the upper most of my heart for she has done more for me than any other human being in the world.  Although her time was limited in caring for us, because of the fact that she worked, I believe she has done her best to bring us up as worthwhile citizens.  The times I and my brothers and sister had with her were memorable ones and I shall remember them all my life.
	I have always considered myself very lucky to have two brothers and a sister.  I believe in the saying “The more the Merrier.”  My older brother, Tack, was the head man and the mischievious (sic) one who lead (sic) us in and out of trouble.  Sis came next, and she was a happy go lucky sort, who I have spent many happy hours sharing all my secrets and troubles.  If I didn’t have her I think you might as well cut the world in half.  Don’t believe she’s all sugar and molasses!  Not by a long shot, for she has her bad points too.  My brother and her were only a year apart and sometimes they were considered twins, for they acted alike.  They are always reminded of the time when I was born and dad was trying to sing me to sleep, that they would go into the adjoining room and sing as loud as they knew how to keep me from dozing off.  Now you know I came next in line and last but not least was my younger brother.  Here is the other half I had the most fights with.  He is a thin, tall (growing every minute) boy and with a mishap at Santa Anita lost his tree front teeth.
	There, I have told you about my brothers and sister.  Just draw your own conclusions about them.
	I believe I am not a very religious girl and I have no particular religion, although I started going to a Christian Sunday School as early as four years old.  There, I was in my first play, and spent many a Christmas nights in the small, but charming church.
	In my early childhood all my playmates were very much younger than I.  We lived near a dairy, and the owner had only two children in the family, but here is where we had all the fun.  The girl was considerably younger that I, but was very mature mentally.  We had the whole dairy to play in, and never will I forget the time they locked me in the refrigerator and I came out half frozen.
	Real human beings were not the only playmates I had.
	I have two great loves:  one is flowers and the other one is animals.  Mother always said I picked up every stray dog or cat that passed our house.  My favorite pet was a terrier-mongrol (sic), who when we received it, was named after my favorite comic strip (at that time), Skippy.  Although my brother brought him home he like me better than any member of the family.  I was the one that fed him, brought him up, and took care of him when he was runned (sic) over by a careless driver.  Skippy and I spent many of our leisure time together.
	As any ordinary girl I had dolls as another sort of playmate.  Every Christmas, it seemed, I added another collection to my doll family.  My favorite one was a negro rag doll called, Mammy.  She was my companion n bed, because if I slept on her it would not hurt her in any way.
	Maybe it is peculiar, but I have always enjoyed going to school.  My first school, up to the sixth grade was Greenwood, then for a very short while it was Central, and up to the time of my evacuation I was in Montebello Junior High School.
	As I passed grade by grade, I began to think certain subjects were more enjoyable to me than some of the others.  For instance Biology and Physical Education were two of my favorite subjects.  I believe the teacher had a great deal to do with making me decide those subjects were my favorites.  I have no particular dislike for any subject, but I think I study much harder for the classes I like best.
	One thing that I have learned in school, was to be a good sport at all times, not only on the playing field, and to get along with our fellow students, no matter what race or color he or she may be.
	My interests lies (sic) in sports.  When I was young, I was pretty much of a tomboy, so I enjoyed playing football with the neighborhood boys until I got up into junior high.  Since we lived out in the country, we had plenty of open spaces and many a times have I enjoyed a rousing game of football.
	Volleyball and basketball and baseball are to me the most favorites of my games.  I also enjoy a good game of ping pong.
	Going into my interest in clubs, I have been in several clubs, most of which were school organizations.
	The club I enjoyed the most was the Tri*Y Club, which was a worthwhile one, and in which I held the office of Vice President.  We also had pins representing our organization.
	Our first school carnival was originated by this club and I am mighty proud to say it was a “Howling” success.
	I have been on the Honor Society, for four years and we took many a worthwhile trips while in this club.
	The junior Toastmasters was another club that has a purpose which I believe helped me to a great extend (sic).  It helped me in improving considerably in speaking with ease in front of a class although I still get stage fright.
	I could go on and on but their (sic) isn’t room enough (sic) to tell all of what one thinks or says.
	Any normal high school “kid” likes to go around in gangs.  Well, I was a typical example.  Our gang had about seven members, all of which were Caucasians, with the exception of my pal, Grace and I.  We did what any teen age youngster would do.  Such as sharing with each other our troubles, throwing parties, and food that we had were divided among everyone.  It is very hard to say how we got together but everyone liked sports, studied pretty hard, and enjoyed a good laugh and well, they were just a swell bunch of girls.  We had our bad moments such as bickering and even quarreling among ourselves, but everyone was so jovial it was forgotten in a minute.  I could describe each and everyone but it will have to wait until some other time.
	Parting from them when evacuation arose was one of the hardest and saddest thing that ever happened to me.
	I have a very unusual hobby, and as I grew older, I began to be ashamed of telling folks my hobby, because they would laugh and tell me I was still a baby.  You see, I collect paper dolls, and make my own design on the clothes I make for them.  Some of my collections are as, the Dionne Quintuplets, Shirley Temple, and numerous others ranging in size.  I honestly have spent many a happy hours (sic) designing and collecting these dolls.
	Hobbies were not my only source of entertainment.  Although I did not go to the movies very often, I enjoyed now and then an interesting picture, but radio was my companion day and night.  Nothing, I say, has more variety then (sic) the radio.  My favorite programs were Jack Benny, Lux Theater, First Nighter and Kay Kyser.
	I do not like formal parties but if its just a (sic) informal gathering, nothing gives me more pleasure then (sic) going to one.  This is one way to get acquainted with different types of people.
	Another source of entertainment for me were books.  From as early as the first grade I began taking books out of the library and by the time I reached the eighth grade I had read practically all the good books on the juvenile section.
	If the book was good I could never lay it down, even though mother would call me time and time again to run an errand for her or that it was time to eat.
	Since dad and mom never had any specific vacation, we never did go to any real interesting or unusual place, so my summer time was spent in my hometown.  Our municipal plunge was my chief enjoyment during the hot summer months.
	The first paying job I had, was when our whole crowd, decided to work in the school cafeteria.  We had more fun in there, and it got so that we knew exactly what every student got for his or her lunch every noon.
	I am very proud of Montebello Junior High School’s cafeteria because it has been publicized in most every state in the Union, because of the low cost they sold their food for.  M.J.H. became famous on their five cent plate lunches. (which I sold every noon.)
	“Remember Pearl Harbor.”  I could still clearly remember that sunny December afternoon when I heard Hawaii’s, Pearl Harbor, had been attacked.  Right there and then the world seemed to crumbled (sic) under my feet.  My first thought was, what will the people think or feel towards us at school tomorrow?  All day long I moped around the house with a face longer then (sic) a horse, but the incident that knocked the wind out of me was when the man my father was working for was taken by the F.B.I. because they said he was a (sic) enemy alien and was very dangerous to this country.
	The morning after at school, I am proud to say that everyone treated us like American’s (sic), which we are, and believe me when I say that with the unity this country has we’ll win this war!
	The days that followed were hectic ones, with rumors flying thick.  It became so that you could not believe anyone.
	Then came the curfew, which bonded us in our homes from eight at night to six in the morning.  Banks closed their doors on us with our money, making us feel very insecure.
	Although all this was happening the Caucasan (sic) teachers and my friends aided us in every way possible.  I and many others helped in selling war bonds at school.
	Again rumors came that General Dewitt was evacuating all Japanese, both citizens and aliens alike out of the strategic military zones and Terminal Island.  This, of course, came true, and the papers had nothing but the evacuation news in them.  All was quiet for a few months when one day in April, after Easter vacation, our neighbor came bursting in the house, yelling that we would be evacuated in a week, I didn’t believe a word he said, but a few days later, bulletins were put up all over the town informing all Japanese that we would soon have to leave.
	It seemed just like yesterday as I recall the rushing and storing of our household goods.
	Thursday, April the ninth, was my last day in school.  Saying good bye to all my teachers and friends was very hard and sad.  Everyone was kind and the members of the homeroom gave me a school pin to remember them by, while my gang gang (sic) gave me a going away present.  I received notes that day from my crowd telling me to keep my chin up and hope for the best, for we’ll meet again someday.
	Everyone thought we would be going to Manzanar, but we landed in Santa Anita.
	The day we left (April 14) it rained and the going was pretty tough.  We left from Downey, California in a large Caravan procession and arrived in Santa Anita after a two hour ride, feeling very cramped and cross.
	The most disappointing thing about Santa Anita was that we lived in stables with no ventilation or privacy what-so-ever.
	All in all the months spent at the famous racetracks were different and I think I adapted myself to liking it and making the best of the situation.
	My first graduation was held in the grandstand of Santa Anita, while a school seminar was also held there.  Church services were attended by many of the people who listened to speakers every Sunday among camouflage nets.
	All was not peace and quiet in this center, for we had this riot which nearly ended disastrously.
	It seems that everything does not run smoothly on the road of life.  There are the ups and downs.  Just as we were getting used to the place and having ice cream every Sunday, another evacuation notice was posted.  Again hectic days followed and leaving our new found friends were harder yet.  Saying good bye to them early in the morning through a barbed wire fence and waiting until the train pulled out and seeing the silently weeping ones made a lump come in my throat.
	The day arrived when we said good bye to every one (sic) and saw for the last time the horse barracks all in a row and turned our faces toward the south to Rohwer, Arkansas.
	The trip was long and tiresome, although some of the states had some pretty scenery.  When I sighted Rohwer, I was dusty, tired and hot, but tremendously happy to see the center, and I personally believe its (sic) one of the best.
	Now I have come to the finishing point of my autobiography, so I will write “30” and I just hope you have read it through to the end.

My Autobiography
	It was on the morning of November 21, 1926, that the town of Redondo Beach, California, had another citizen to add to its population.  I was born in the little red house which I have called home all my life, prior to the evacuation.
	Papa’s occupational interest has always been agriculture, and that was what we were doing on a hundred acre truck farm.  Farm life was healthful and educational—but very hard.
	My mother was a very generous person who tried her utmost to guide her offsprings (sic) into decent citizens.  I hope her efforts have not been in vain.  The children in our family were often naughty.  However, mother’s punishment was seldom, but it was certainly severe enough to not be easily forgotten.  I think the biggest thing that ever happened to me is when my parents passed away.  Mother was stricken with an incurable disease which took her away from us on December 1, 1937.  The following February my father died in an automobile accident.  Those are two unforgettable incidents.  At present, we are living with my married sister and her family.

	By we, I am naturally referring to my two other sisters and brother.  I am fortunate—perhaps unfortunate enough—in being the youngest member of our family.  My married sister is the eldest, 24, and my brother 22, and my sisters follow, 20 and 18 respectively.  As for maturing mentally, we are more advanced than most of our friends of our respective ages, considering the fact that we had to more or—less go on our own at an earlier age.  Scholastically, we cannot boast to a very great extent but all my sister’s (sic) have received told torches at hi (sic) school graduation and my brother was honored by having the second highest scholastic standing in his graduating class.  Anyone from California knows what those honors mean.  I sincerely hope I can live up to their standards.

	Our parents were both Buddhists, but we children attended a Christian church for a short while.  Then when I became old enough, each Saturday, I roped about 6 miles for a Japanese education.  Since this school also served as a Buddhist temple, we preyed (sic) before each morning session and after school.  We were more or less converted into Buddhists.

	Living on a fairly large sized farm, we had very few neighbors.  Nearby were two families in which there were some girls of my age.  Unfortunately both families moved away after away. (sic)  Outside of school chums, my only close companions were members of my immediate family.

	We had many animals running about the yard.  Among them were chickens, which we somehow couldn’t manage to penned in (sic), and also geese, of all things.  I remember vaguely an incident with our goose.  As a little girl I was very much afraid of those awful hissing creatures that up and snapped at me.  It soon became so difficult to stand those vicious attacks that I finally let out a long healthy yelp.  My father came running out to my rescue, I thought, but only to tie a rope around the bird’s neck.  I wondered what he was up to, and I soon found out for he handed me the end of the rope and made me pull the goose around.  I was horror-stricken, but I did get over my fear of geese.  Other than the feathered pets, there was always at least one dog around.  We had a cow and goat too, several years ago.  Cats were very common things around our yard.  At one time there were 31, actually!  Naturally we had horses to plow our fields, and a couple rabbits were kept in hutches, but they multiplied in short order.  When we tired of gathering alfalfa for them each day, they had to be eaten.

	School always seemed to be interesting to me.  Sometimes it was to show off a near article of clothing, but usually it was what class work held in store for me.  In elementary school, I spelled and drew a little better than most students, therefore I was called “teacher’s pet.”  I enjoyed.  The school had an honorary organization known as the “safety committee” and in that club I was elected president for three consecutive semesters.  That would have made anyone feel wonderful.  Math and science have always been interesting subjects for me.  They seem to hold mysteries that give great satisfaction when uncovered.  History and foreign language have been hard to enjoy.  But dispute (sic) my liked and disliked, I have managed to be a member of the Scholarship Society each semester of high school back home.

	I doubt if there is such a thing as talent in me for I can neither carry a tune nor create anything beautiful.  But I find slating quite interesting and I am also spending some spare time writing little stories.  They are more or less my hobbies, and among others that I enjoy doing are knitting, sewing, and dancing.

	In high school, I must have developed an inferiority complex along with unsocialableness (sic) for I never went around in a gang and stuck to a limited number of friends.  When I joined clubs, I dropped them quite readily as I could find no interest in them.  Football and other school sports did attract me, however, as it did the rest of the students.

	Movies were always enjoyable though I did not patronize the theater very often.  That made one appreciate them much more.  The radio is nearly always on full blast.  The entire family seems to enjoy it for it seems we all have our favorite programs.  Comedians are seldom unwelcome, and news over the air seems to be the quickest way to hear about the goings on outside.  It is very infrequent that I attend social gatherings outside, but in camp they are very entertaining and I seem to find myself there quite often.

	We weren’t the vacationing sort, I guess, but the longest vacation that I can recall is the one we took in 1935 to see the San Diego World’s Fair.  We stayed for only three days but remembered it much longer.  The summer vacations from school were usually spent helping around the farm.

	Life was quiet, normal with a few highlights here and there until the war broke out.  Then things begin (sic) to happen.  For a while the government seemed to be debating as to whether the Japanese should be evacuated or not.  The affirmative case was favored and the Japanese people were soon getting rid of their properties at prices were dirt cheap.  Somehow we managed to sell off ours at a half reasonable fare.  On rainy April 14 we arrived by bus at the Santa Anita racetracks that was to be our temporary home.

	When first reaching the camp, we were checked briefly by the health examiner (sic) and promptly issued us our living quarters.  It is difficult to imagine our dismay when we first set foot in our new home.  How could we live in such poor lighted and ventilated horse stables that were crowded and smelled badly besides.  We assured ourselves it was only temporary—only for a week or two and then they would transfer us to our real destination—then unknown.  But the understood two weeks passed into months.  During that while, I met many people from all walks of life and all of whom were in the same situation as I—unwanted by the people outside.  At least that was our lone bitter thought then.   Later after considering the whole thing, we came to realize that our way of thinking was incorrect—is meant merely that we are confined in camps for our own protection.  However, it was not easy to realize that.
	We tried our best to adapt ourselves to the new environment.  At first food was poor but we all made the most of it.  The wages were ranging from $8 to $16 monthly.  Those with the latter rate were considered professionals.  Still the Japanese morale was not lowered to an extensive degree.  The recreation department planned programs, movies, Saturday night dances, and competitive sports and proved themselves very capable.  Church services, schools, and seminar classes were conducted in the grandstand where once the wealthy celebrity watched the horses outrun each other.  In 6 months the camp improved considerably.

	The highlights of the half year there were the riot and fever.  During a house-to house inspection for contrabands, some policemen were accused of stealing money.  The people mobbed them and there was quite a hubbub about it all.  Mail and outside communication were halted for several days.  Finally everything back to “normal” but not before making the front page of the papers.

	Sometime in August, in the night, we heard cries of fire and a good portion of the camp of 18,000 population ran out to witness the spectacle.  The jockey grandstand burned thoroughly.  The source of the fire was never learned.  An amusing incident of the fire is that that night the firemen were having a ball.  In combating the fire their Sunday best become soaking wet!  A few weeks following canteen no. 2 made a huge blaze caused by faulty water.

	At Santa Anita the 1st permanent relocation notice were being issued about the middle of August.  The initial movement consisted of the former residents of San Diego county.  I was really sorry to see them go.  Following them was the group that left for Heart Mt., Wyoming, then Colorado, and we came in the fourth movement.

	Boring is no word for the trip over.  All we saw were plains and deserts with a few—cities after long intervals.  Our coach seats could not be turned into sleepers.  The whole ride quite uncomfortable (sic).  Others tell us they had chicken often on their trains, but stew seems to have been our basic food.

	Once more we are making attempts to accept new surroundings as home.  Someday, however, we hope all will be forgotten and we may live together in peace and content.

My Autobiography

	My name is Mori Shibata.  I was born in Los Angeles, California, on the twenty third day of January in the year nineteen hundred and twenty five.  I am the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. George Kintaro Shibata.  My birth rank is second, having an elder sister, who is with my grandparents in Japan at the present time, and a smaller sister, who is with us here.  I parted with my elder sister at the age of three, but I have no recollection of that event whatsoever.
	At the time of my birth my father was engaged in the maintenance of a small grocery store, which until the time of evacuation we carried on.  The store was located in the middle east sector of the city, some two miles from the heart of Los Angeles, and Broadway.
	While in my early childhood I loved to go shopping with my mother and ride the elevators and escalators of the very large department stores downtown.
	Entrance to public school, stands vividly in my mind.  At the age of five I was enrolled in Breed Street Elementary School a few blocks south from our store.  It was there I first met my favorite chum named Peter Esakoff a blond Russian lad.  I can still see myself trudging along to kindergarten, hand in hand with Peter, both in knee-pants.  Pictures of those melancholy school days twelve years ago bring forth chuckles today.  Indeed!  I shall never forget those elementary school days.
	Seven years of school at Breed Street School passed eventless, and I was promoted to Hollenbeck Junior High, the largest and most modern Junior High, west of the Mississippi River.  When the name Hollenbeck in mentioned today I recall the stream-lined buildings and public address systems, which were installed in every room, and were so rare even in the largest of City schools.  It was at this school I became interested in aviation, and I planned my program accordingly.  Ever since this time I have continued my hobby of model airplane making.
	Maintaining a “B” average I graduated into Senior High.  The school, Roosevelt High, was noted for its mixture of different nationalities.  At that school we had every part of the globe represented.  The annual “international dress-up day” was really a sight.  Everything from Hula skirts to Scottish skirts could be seen.
	I took an academic course, intending to go to some advance school in Aeronautical Engineering, majoring in Mathematics.  Throughout my High School days I found football was my favorite sport.  Although I could not participate I loved to watch inter-high school games.  Last years (sic) football team was surpream (sic), running through all opponents easily.
In the last half of my second year of School, this present war broke out.  Nevertheless everyone attended school as usual.  Then on Friday, March the thirteenth by some mistake I gather, my father was taken in by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for questioning.  They promised his return in two or three days, but for some reason or other they broke it.  My mother was broken hearted, and I quit school immediately.  Together we gradually sold-out products until finally nothing remained.  Later we were forced to move into a friend’s home.  From then on for about two weeks I traveled to the United States District Attorney’s Office to plea for my father’s release.  Finally giving up hope we voluntarily entered Santa Anita.  About three months later unexpectedly a parole was granted for my father and he was returned to us looking years older and very thin.  From then on spirits were high in our family and I began working for the government making camoflage (sic) nets for the Army and then as a dish washer.
We did not mind whether we lived in stables or not for our family was reunited.  For the same reason our trip to unknown Rohwer Arkansas was moreorless (sic) like a vacation rather than a forcible evacuation.
We arrive (sic) at this camp on October seven, after a four day trip through California, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, and Louisiana.  For a time I held a job as a warehouse worker, but since school has been established I have quit.
I am presently located at Block 12, Building 2, Apartment D.

My Autobiography

	My mother’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Sumida lived in a small city called Fumegun, Okayama.  A place of mountains and more mountains (sic).  They were farmers that had to work from early morning till late evening.  They grew plenty of rice and vegetables for their own use.
	
	Mr and Mrs Shimizu, my father’s parents lived in Osato, Saitama.  They were also farmers and grew what most of the farmers in Japan have been growing, that is rice, plenty of wheat and mulberry leaves for the silkworms.

	Fourty (sic) years ago in 1902, my father left Japan bound for America.  He arrived in Vancouver, Canada with the intentions of being a business man.  With very few friends and only able to speak a little of our American language, he went to a business school and also learned how to speak better English.  After years of studying and working.  By a friends (sic) my mother came into the picture.  In old times they had “Picture Marriages”.  In 1914, my mother arrived in Vancouver to get married.  After their “Picture Marriage” they came to Los Angeles, California cause (sic) they heard that it was a good place.

	On April 5, 1927 I was born in Los Angeles, California.  When I was five, I started elementary school, 20th Street school.  After six years in elementary, I went to Lafayette Jr. High.  During the three years which I spent I Jr. High, I met many new friends that made things happier and lazier.  I was most interested in Glee Club which I spent five terms.  During these five terms we sang with other schools at the Hollywood Bowl and sang at other places.

	When I was in the B-8 my sister Charlotte, left for Hawaii on a three years or more contract, to work as the Y.W.C.A. Secretary in Honolulu.  My brother Lincoln, was attending the University of Verkiley (sic).  That left three of us at home.  My Brother Arthur, who attending L.A.J.C. and my sister who was going to the University of California.

	With all efforts after the five terms that I spent in Glee Club I earned a pin.  The six terms I stayed at Jr. High were the most joyous.  I attended Polytechnic High in Los Angeles, California for almost a year.

	During my first term at Polytechnic my brother, Arthur, was taken in the Army and my other brother who had been in the Army was released.  My sister was attending a nurses training in Berkeley.

	Just before evacuation I had to quit school.  My sister Marie had to come home from Berkiley (sic) too.  We helped clean the grocery store that we had then On May 7, 1942 we were evacuated into Santa Anita Assembly Center.  After about five months in Santa Anita we were relocated way over here in Rohwer Relocation Center while my sister as a student nurse got orders to go to Gila Relocation.

	After I finish my lasts two years in High School I want to complete my schooling thru University and if this tragic thing is over I would like very much to go to Hawaii where my sister is now staying.

My Autobiography

	My special mailman, “Doc” Stork delivered me to my future home in Huntington Beach in Southern California.  The date is recorded as January 6, 1926.  I led a happy life, eating and sleeping all day, day after day until I grew out of it several years later.
When I was about four years old, our family moved to Lodi up north where I lived prior to evacuation.  When I reached the age of six, I was put in the first grade much to my objection.  My final gruesome year passed through quickly and to my utter amazement I was promoted to the second grade.  From this point I lived through seven torturous years of school until I was given a diploma and rushed off to the high school
My high school career started off with a nice bang (from a upper classman) but toward the end of the year I virtually came to a halt.  My second year I had more sense so I beared (sic) down on my studies and I came through.
Then came May 15, and a order from John DeWitt for us to evacuate.  I quit school, just before the final examination and to camp.  May 19 found me in Stockton Assembly Center, my home until October 7.  On October 7th we left Stockton and California for Arkansas.
We passed through Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and back to Arkansas.  Until we hit Arkansas and Tennessee, I never saw so many negroes in my life.
When I first arrived it was hard to understand the way they talk, but it’s pretty easy now.  These people out here aren’t so bad once you get used to them.
I hope in the future, that I can go back to beautiful California, the land of the sunshine.

Autobiography

	I often wonder if other mothers love to tell their children of their childhood as much as my mother loves to do.  She is still capable of doing just that even today.  We enjoy immensely what she tells us in her most charming way.  Sometimes I find myself blushing furiously when she looks at me with a twinkle in her eyes and says with a severe twist to her lips to keep from smiling, “Nabuko, I don’t believe any mother ever had to cope with such an ill tempered, mischieveous (sic), and so charmless a child!”
I was born one hot July morning about nine o’clock on a farm near Hayward.  The heat was terrific that morning when Mrs. Hanzaura gave birth to a baby girl.  A few days later the parents named the baby girl Nabuko.
As I proceeded to grow day by day, I grew chubbier than ever.  However my being very chubby didn’t stop me from being a naughty youngster.  Mother had to spank me often trying her best to teach me from being such a prankish brat.
One afternoon, I had done something that irrated (sic) my mother so much that she finally decided a closet would never do!  So off she marched with my squirmy hand tightly caught in hers to the tank house across the house.  With out (sic) a word she locked me in the dreary room which had but one window for the light to come through.  Of course I was frantic and resolved not to do any bad tactics again but collecting my tears again I felt that old itchy feeling in the palm of my clenched hands.  A smile crossed my face as I fumbled for a piece of rock.  In the next minute a terrible crash was heard and the patter of mommy’s shoes were heard (sic).  I had broken the window into bits.  The door opened and there I stood with a guilty look not knowing whether to look up or wondering if it was for the best to turn my back to mom for a couple of spankings.
Even though I was a brat eventually mother was able to teach me all the things a little girl should know.
Daddy was working as a gardener and every evening we, my little sister and myself, would wait for his return.  Just as his car came to an abrupt stop, two pairs of tiny patters was (sic) always heard running to meet daddy.  He would always satisfy my hungar (sic) for candy by bringing home bags of candy.
Having playmates other than my younger sister was a rare occasion for me, because my life so far had been on a farm where neighbors lived miles away.  Pets were my favorite and even today I have a great likeness for dogs and cats.
Up to the eighth grade I have been moving from one school to another.  I graduated from a small country school named Rindge where majority of my years were spent.  Even in the grammar school I had always tried hard in the field of mathematics but always had an average grade or below.  This also proved true in the first year in high school.  I don’t know why this is so unless I dislike the subject for in the field of Social Study I had a grade above average.  I have always loved to read a great deal.
My teachers have told me that I have a great deal of tallent (sic) in art.  I may not have tallent buy my ambition to draw is very great.
I have taken no interest in any clubs nor (sic) civics.  This was due to the fact that I have always lived in the country from the time when I was able to take interest in community projects.
Hobbies that I have are very few.  I draw figures and also collect them from friends and from magazine (sic).  I love to sing and so I made it a hobby to collect words for new numbers.  My friends have come over so that they may have their picture drawn.  I consider this a hobby when I draw their pictures for them.
Radio has been one of my favorite amusements next to attending the theater on Sundays.
Working during the vacation was what kept me busy.  I worked out in the field for couple of weeks and then kept the house clean with my sister.  Working out in the field is wonderful.  We talked to each other while working and since we girls loved to sing we had a singspiration (sic) out in the field.  The sky from the field is something memorable.  The sky is a glorious blue so soft and smooth.  I often sat for minutes staring upward into the sky.  Feeling of inspiration and of enchantment used to sweep within me.
Traveling to San Francisco took place almost every year during summer vacation.  I used to enjoy those trips very much.
A great change came when Pearl Harbor was bombed.
Yes, we were all waiting for the order of evacuation to come, but I can remember the reaction which took place out in the Ranch one sunny brisk afternoon about four thirty.
That afternoon my mother, dad and I had gone out to the field to do some work on the young celery beds.  I had just looked at my wrist watch anxiously to see if it was about time for retiring from the field when down the dusty road a small figure darted toward the brown, green streaked fields.  Fascinated by the race he was making toward the field, I sat and waited to see what the matter was, if any!
Pantingly (sic) he blurted out the miserable truth.  It had finally come!  The evacuation was to take place within six or seven days after registration at Lodi.  I felt stunned and my will power to work the next hour seem to be beyond my reach as I lamely turned and searched for an answer in my mother’s features who was near by (sic).  I didn’t have to seek long for the sadness in in (sic) her eyes blazed against the sun as she lifted her face up to the sun and sky for the escape of bitterness.
Days passed quickly with packing, cleaning, shopping, and many other things.  Soon the day arrived for the evacuation of the people who lived on the island outside of Stockton.
It was a cool misty morning when we all traveled to Lodi on automobiles where we were to be transphered (sic) to buses.  Some women and girls were bursting into bitter tears and some stared nonshallantly (sic) into space.  I had cried enough the day before when our dog was taken away.  We had given him away to an American whom we knew to be capable of giving the dog a nice secure home.  Tears seem to dim my eyes but I proceeded to hold it back through thin twisted lips,”Whats (sic) the use of bawling any way!”
Finally we were on the Grey hound bus traveling swiftly toward our destination.  I was sitting beside my young excited sister.  I have never felt so helpless, unhappy, and frightened in my life as I had felt that morning.  Tightening my grip on the arm of the seat, I peered through the window pane trying to remember each and every inch of the beautiful valley I passed so quick and so swiftly.
Destination brought a sigh of great tiredness to me.  As we descended the bus steps we were surrounded (sic) by earlier evacuees to the center welcoming Us.  Then we were trudging down a dusty, hot street to our assigned apartment.
Standing there in the dismal cemented floored apartment I felt lost in thoughts of what was ahead of us.  I felt so completely baffled about the whole situation I wanted to disappear from the earth.
As days became weeks my dad and mom worked so hard to beautify the apartment that we all pitched in just as hard as they did.  Eventually I became accustomed to the environment of the Stockton Assembly Center.  I began to look forward to each day with full of ambition which was a wonderful sign of pulling through the mist of confusion.
We are still all pitching in and working together trying to secure happiness even in a center and I believe we are doing quite well.

Mr. Robert Blood 25 Auburn St., Concord, New Hampshire
Dear Mr. Blood:
This letter is a joint letter to you and Miss Cheek giving a few more details about life and work in the center.
Out camp is thirteen miles from McGehee, Arkansas, very rough miles. Consequently, most of our time is spent "inside". The single persons on the staff are housed in rather small dormitory room and eat in the mess for appointed personnel. The expense of food is relatively small. Regular boarders are charged actual cost. It never runs higher than 30¢ per meal,
You of course will know about the kind of clothes which would be appropriate. We WALK a great deal. Our streets are gravel. Consequently, you will need shoes with heavy soles. Composition or rubber is more satisfactory.
We would be your debtor if you would bring your records for folk dances. Any material that are not too bulky for you to bring would perhaps prove useful, especially on outdoor games, scouting, parties. Such tools as "Handy" are of real service. Persons ordinarily come to McGehee and we meet them there. Please let us know the exact time of your arrival at McGehee,
Cordially yours,
Nat R, Griswold Supervisor

Dear friends;
All of the "Y's" are helping to furnish the Canteen Room for "Teen-agers" at Rohwer Relocation Center. Philander already promises magazine subscriptions; Magnolia A & M, records; Conway State Teachers, games, etc. But still - there are a lot of things to be gotten, such as 
More magazine subscriptions Kemtone (for walls) Piano
Games, puzzles, etc. Folding chairs
Extension cords, plugs, sockets, etc. Floor and table lamps
Doesn't the project sound interesting?
More records - (mostly popular)
Throw rugs
Curtains
Card tables
Easy chairs
Handicrafts
Ping-pong table and set 
We should like to get it set up and going no later than December 15. Do you suppose you could let me know what items you can contribute, so that I'll know what will be needed?
Let's really do a good job!
Yours in service,
Yvonne M. Bradley

Mr, Lowell Manning Spaulding Athletic Company 3rd and Louisiana Street Little Rock, Arkansas
Dear Mr, Manning:
Our boys are highly pleased that you are bringing the Spaulding team on Sunday, July 9.
There are several questions we would like you to answer. Will 2 p.m. be satisfactory for the calling of the game? What time would you plan to arrive? How many men will you bring? Would you fellows enjoy eating supper at the regular mess halls in the center? The members of our squad will be very happy to take the members of your team Into their respective mess halls. It might prove very interesting to them.
If you have an umpire, we would be glad for him to be used. However, we have able umpires here and would be glad to furnish both of them if you desire.
We look forward to your visit.
Sincerely yours.
Nat R, Griswold Supervisor of C. A.

Dear Mr. Finch:
Belatedly I am forwarding you a bill containing playground equipment which you suggested we buy and charge to the fund which the boys at Camp Shelby so generously provided.
As you notice, we purchased ropes for 10 swings, oil to waterproof the rope, iron rod for making trapeze rings and pipe for making trapeze bars. The total netted $20.19.
Since it was a local merchant, I paid the amount indicated on the enclosed bill from him. In case funds are still available you may reimburse me, otherwise forget the whole matter.
We enjoyed the recant visit of the boys from Camp Shelby, including their orchestra. We hope you may visit us again before too long.
Sincerely yours, COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES

Colonel Sherman L. Watts, C.O. 171st Infantry Battalion Camp Shelby, Mississippi
Dear Colonel Watts:
Since my letter of September 15th, a request has come from the Community Council for me to pass on to you. A committee of the Council wishes to have a firing squad from your command to take part in a memorial service honoring the men from our Center who have been casualties in Italy.
To date we have had three men killed and three men wounded from this Center. The move to hold a memorial service was initiated by the Community Council and the local USO Committee. It probably will be of real value to community morale and loyalty.
You will know the number of men needed for this service. We are attempting to make arrangements for necessary rifles and ammunition from the local Military Police unit. If we can do this, it would be unnecessary for your men to transport these. The tentative date for the memorial service is September 30, at 2:00 PM. We would like to know as soon as possible whether you can send a firing squad.
Sincerely
Ray D. Johnston Project Director

Dear Mr. Finch:
I have just returned from watching the children sliding, swinging, and turning on the equipment which the men of the 442nd Combat Team generously gave our center. These children were pre-school age. The small slides and low swings are just right for them. It would have warmed your heart to have watched them. Inspite of the fact that we had to use the timbers out from the woods and erect them with unskilled laborers, the complete layout locks quite neat. Of course, we will hope to add other pieces of equipment which we have not yet gotten, especially the teeter-totters.
The Community Council is planning a Play Day for November 11. At this time, the Playground Committee wishes to dedicate officially the playground. They wish to know if you would be able to attend. Of course, we know how busy you are, but we entertain the hope that you may happen to be free. If so, we would be greatly pleased to have a visit from you.
Cordially yours,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities

Dear Brother:
We are having an Art Exhibit extraordinary on this weekend, February 24-25th, during the day and evening. We thought you, some or your young people, ana friends might be interested in dropping by for this exhibit.
This is the exhibit or the oil paintings or Mr. Henry Sugimoto, an artist, who has studied in Paris and has received wide recognition. He has conceived it his mission to make a graphic portrayal or the intimate experiences connected with evacuation and relocation. More than a year ago, Hendrix College had him to exhibit his works for the College community.
You and interested friends will be very welcome to come at any time during the Saturday or Sunday. persons coming by your invitation will merely need to identify themselves to the Military Police as belonging to your party coming to visit the exhibition.
I hope some of you will find it possible to visit us during this exhibition.
Sincerely yours,
Nat R. Griswold Supervisor Community Activities

Dear Dr. Griswold:
I do hope that during this coming week the center will be flooded with all sorts of things for the Canteen Room. I should have like to visit all the organizations and tell them what we wanted, but I do keep so very busy.
We have enjoued working with the Project and do hope that we have helped a little.
When everything has arrived, I should like to know how it all came out. Perhaps I and some others of us may have a chance to visit.
Do have a good holiday season and express our greetings to those there.

Dear Miss Bradley:
There came to our Youth Canteen yesterday, our first issue of Negro Digest. I feel that we are indebted to you and your organization for this magazine. Let me express our appreciation.
Personally, I was quite unacquainted with this periodical and expect to subscribe for it. So you see your activity has a widening circle of influence.

To a service man leaving for active duty. Dear Friend:
It is the custom of the Rohwer YMCA to give a complimentary membership card, good for the duration, to each service man from the center. You will find it an introduction to good men around the world who will be your friends, and to institutions which can be of service to you. We present it to you with the heartiest of good wishes for your welfare in every way.
Cordially,

Dear Mr. Finch:
The wheel chair reached McGehee Saturday and was delivered to us this morning. We hope to put it in the hands of the recipient this afternoon. Not all arrangements have been completed yet. As soon as we have completed the transaction we will drop you a line giving name and address of the girl and parents for your information.
The chair is well made and looks fine. We all appreciate this generousity of your mother.
Cordially yours,

Dear Bill:
The people here were pleased with your visit and your expressed interest in our activities. We personally enjoyed your stay and that of Mr. Levine and Mr. Ingram.
We remember your suggestion of a return engagement. The Engei Kai, a drama club, is presenting two evenings of classical oriental drama on the nights of April 21 and 22. This is a well organized group and their performances are of good quality. Their shows are classical in character and are interesting from the standpoint of history of drama. I might suggest also that when they say an evening of drama, they mean an evening; their performances ordinarily run hours. It would not be necessary however for you to stay through the entire performance if you do not feel it is possible. But the best numbers always come at the last.
Remember my suggestion that you come early enough to look over the project here.
Cordially yours,
Nat R. Griswold Supervisor

Dear Sirs:
In response to your letter of March 13 we are enclosing a check for $126.60 to cover the cost of the following service banners listed in your circular 395. After consultation with the Community Council who is distributing these to the families of servicemen here. I find we need a total of 450 Printed Anninart Banners, 8 x 12 inches with stars as follows:
300 — 1 star banners 120 — 2 star banners 12 — 3 star banners
this totals 3 gross, or $120. In addition we would like 12 — 3 star banners at $4.00. Also we need 6 — 4 star banners. While your catalogue does not indicate prices for additional stars we are adding 10c per banner for the extra stars or $2.60.
We recognize that this is more than twice the amount about which we first inquired and that you have no obligation to supply the addition. If you are unable to do so will you please forward at least 1 1/2 gross—1 gross of 1 star banners and 1/2 gross of 2 star banners.
We would appreciate a prompt reply to our request.
Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Lloyd:
We are sorry that our hardball diamond has been permitted to grow up in weeds. It will hardly pay us to get it in shape for a single game or two. Please get in touch with us next spring about hardball.
We are playing softball and would be glad to play most any Sunday afternoon, girls, boys or old men. You will need to let us know if you plan to come by Thursday before the Sunday game.
Thank you for this inquiry and interest in our activities.
Sincerely,

Dear Miss Bradley:
We have received a copy of your attractive letter to the College Associations suggesting things they might do to help equip the Teen-Age Club here. Your suggestions are all in order and will not conflict with the plans here. I will show you letter to the head of the club and the adviser. It certainly will plase them.
I've spoken to Dr. Garrott with reference to the requests in your letter. I am sure he will write you soon. The dimensions of the windows are unusual. These buildings are like array barracks. The windows consist of one sash 40" x 44" placed near the top of the wall with bottom 4 feet from the floor. There will be 8 such windows on each side making a total of 16. Dr. Garrott will be sending you this information. I thought I might include it in my letter.
Again let me thank you for the energetic way you are following up the plans made at Conway.
Sincerely,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities

Dear Mr. Finch:
The chairs arrived very promptly. Notice came of the arrival of the couch from Atlanta at the Express Office in McGehee. So it appears everything will be ready for your coming on next Sunday.
The Council is very much interested in your visit. The chairman of that group is anxious to have you see all the boys and girls and for them to see you. So with him we have made plans which I hope you will find it possible to follow. The plan is for the children to gather, two blocks in one mess at a specified time, here you and the boys with you present to the blocks their allotment of candy and gum. By assembling two blocks together you will have to make only 16 presentations. We think the maximum of 15 minutes should be taken at each place. This means we can do the job between one to five Sunday afternoon. I am enclosing a schedule of time and hope it does not seem too formal and too routine.
We could have the presentation of the furniture in the old men's parlor at 10:00 a.m. Sunday morning. Richard Arao is making plans for this event.
You maybe sure the kindness of you and of the men of the 171st are causing quite a stir.
Sincerely yours.

Dear Mr. Finch:
This is to report details of the delivery of the chair to Kaname Nasu, 1-8-F.
Present for the presentation was Lloyd Shingu, secretary of the local Red Cross, Bean Takeda, Assistant Reports Officer, Mr.Matsui, the block manager.
The Red Cross had a photographer who made pictures. The sun was bright so we moved Kaname out in front of the barrack. We took a picture of her and her mother; also, one of the whole party. Mr. Yakura of our art department made a gift card. The girls in our office (Mary Yamada) tied a gay bow of crepe paper around the chair.
We hope the picture of Kaname and her mother’s good enough to present a special copy to your mother.
Wish you could have seen the smile on Kaname’s face after we had wheeled her back into the barrack room.
Cordially,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor

Dear Mr. Eaton:
After the event I am enclosing an invitation to an art exhibit in which I believe you will be interested.
As I mentioned in an earlier report Mr. Sugimoto has considered it his mission to record in graphic form the “inside” aspects of evacuation and the relocation centers. This he has done remarkably: the mixed emotions of a young mother behind barbed wire with  a service flag on the barrack window; the inside detail of life in a barrack house; the beauty spots of lights and shadows; lives and forms, in a dreary world; portraits of mothers and fathers; candid faces at the mess halls; children at play; men at work; mud, rain, and sum. In all he has more than other hundred such paintings – water colors, oils, and tempera. It is quite an exhibit.
As I looked, I t occurred to me a great many persons in the metropolitan area would find these works intensely interesting, from the view point of content and technique. Do you suppose some group or some individual would be willing to sponsor this exhibit there?
Mr. Sugimoto is a graduate of Califnoria College of arts and crafts, Oakland. He did post graduate study in Paris, October 1930 – December 1931. He exhibited in June, 1931, at Exposition de Crecy; in August at Exposition de Lagry. His work was accepted by Salon d’Vretomne.
He and Mrs. Sugimoto are usually congenial and attractive. They are active in school and church. Both teach in the school. He has sponsored an art club here – a producing group.
Your expressed interest in this sort of thing made me bold to share this idea. If such and exhibition should be planned, we at this end would cooperate fully.
Sincerely, 
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor

Dear Mr. Eaton:
Thank you for your kind letter of May 24 concerning Mr. Henry Sugimoto.
I am glad to say that Mr. Sugimoto plans to come to New York sometime in July. At that time he will bring some of his paintings and will confer with you. This will be much more satisfactory than sending examples.
He had planned to come earlier but has recently undergone appendectomy for which he is recovering satisfactorily.
Thank you for your interest in us. I feel certain you will be pleased with Mr. Sugimoto as a person.
Sincerely yours,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor

Dear Mr. Griswold:
In the pressure of work in recent weeks, and my absence from the office much of the time, I am sorry I have not written you about the possibility of an exhibition of the work of Henry Sugimoto. I have made some inquiries here and because of the com paratively recent exhibition of the work of Miss Okubo from the Pacefic Coast I have not yet found an opening. however I will continue, and hope I can find someone who will be interested.
It would help me in this matter if you could send me 6 or 12 examples of Mr. Sugimoto's work which I could return to you within a week or ten days, after I have shown them to some people who may be interested.
I am personally very much interested in the fact that Mr. Sugimoto has made quite a complete record of life in the Center. If you have any description of his work, giving an idea of its scope I would appreciate having it.
Are there any other of the evacuees who have interpreted the life of the center and its surrounding in any other form of art expression? I ask you this because I have heard of a number of instances in which partial records have been made of the evacuees in other camps, and I should like to inform myself more fully about the situation.
Sincerely,
/s/ Allen Eaton

I am very anxious to get from Rohwer Relocation Center as many good examples of handicraft as may be available to photograph here. I am prepared to meet all cost of transportation and insure anything against injury and I could, if you advise it, arrange to purchase certain articles.
Now that modest finances have been arranged, what is the best way to proceed? I would value greatly your opinion on this matter. I will do anything I can to help.
I would appreciate it if you could write me very soon about what you think we can do and what we should do. I realize that you have your hands more than full but perhaps there is someone on your staff or in the camp with whom could take this matter up and get early results.
If you think we should employ someone, please advise me and I will do what I can to meet the situation. I would be glad to send you a check in advance if it would help.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Allen Eaton
P.S. Sometime ago Mr. Stalley wrote me that Miss Mabel R. Jameson might be a good person to contact for handicraft. Is she still there and if so, do you agree with Mr. Stalley?

TO: Community Activities FROM: Community Welfare Section RE: Space for special enterprises
Mr. K. Nii, Block Manager of Block 41, writes to the effect that "The C.A. Department has been trying to secure an apartment for the use of Community-Egei-Bu (Generally known as Adult Show Achievement Division) 41-8-C is vacant at present and 41-8-D will soon be vacant. If any of the above apartments could be reserved or assigned, it would greatly relieve the overcrowding of the dressing and lending room. Kindly give this matter consideration."
We are glad to discuss this matter with you, first to learn what the situation is, and, to review what is possible.
It is our understanding that this service now occupies a room in Barrack 11 in Block 42. Is it a room in addition to the one in Block 42, which the C.A. asks for or to move to 41 from Block 42? Mrs. Stearns recently spoke of a conversation with Mr. Ikebasu about "a room for Mr. Fujii," and suggested that Mr. Fujii apply for living quarters if he prefers to live in the Block." I understand he has been staying In Block 42.
Officials of the Community Cooperative Enterprises and professional men have on several occasion wanted quarters so that they could carry on their business from their homes. The Housing Committee has con¬sistently maintained that until such time as housing facilities are ample enough to meet all such requests similarly that it is impossible to meet any of them. Consequently, we would be unable to set Mr. Fujii up in a private establishment which does not meet the standards that prevail for other people. If C.A. has

need for an additional room for C. A. purposes, we will be glad to take that under consideration as openings occur after all people are taken care of.
There are still six families in Block  39 who are due to move and a great many of the people now out on Seasonal Leave are sure to return. We are making,a desperate effort to locate room for the Nursery Schools. For the present, it appears necessary to continue the use of the room in Block 42 for the costume work and if Mr. Fujii, wishes an assignment as a bachelor in a neighboring block, we will be glad to make such an assignment to him.

Dear Mr. Johnston:
The following equipment has been placed by me at the Rohwer Playground for the use of the resident children:
3	Slides, playground, complete
1 Swing, metal, complete with 3 seats
8 Travel rings with chains
4	Trapeze bars with chains
The title to this property is to remain vested in me and, when the Playground is closed, the Supervisor of the Children's Department of Community Activities is instructed to ship it, via collect freight, to me.
While the property is on the government reservation, the War Relocation Authority is not responsible for any damage to this property from any cause whatsoever, and is in no way accountable for this property.
At the conclusion of the program, the War Relocation Authority shall have no responsibility for the crating, handling, and shipping of the property to me.
Sincerely,

MEMORANDUM

To: Mr. James F. Rains
Subject: Concrete Slabs for Sprinklers
A council in session this morning decided they would like to have sprinklers for the children in each block. According to their understanding, these can be made 14 feet x 14 feet. The council committee had two questions. One, will the engineering Department furnish technical advise on the work or, in other words, will the blocks have to do all of the construction? Second, will the Engineering Staff decide upon the location which best meets engineering requirements?
Mr. Y. Yasuda, 2-9-B, who works at the Dry Goods of the Co-op, is the chairman of the committee on this project.

Re: Need of room by Community Activities for Costumes and Curtain work.
Mr. Griswold reports that he has not yet had time to review the needs for an additional room for Costume and Curtain Mending and Sewing. He is reviewing the matter with the Community Activities staff in the next few days. I have advised him that the Housing Committee stated that 41-8-C should be made available to Community Activities as a work room, in the event the present location in the P.S. hall in Block 38 was considered inadequate.

After conference with both block managers we have worked out the following arrangement with reference to furnishing you space nearer the center of the community. Since the Boy Scouts had previously received official permission to use Public Service Hall 34 and since they now have funds to install a partition, it seems best to let them proceed.
We have cleared matters so that as soon as Public Service Hall 33 is vacated by Cooperative Enterprises you will be permitted to use one half of that hall. All things considered block 33 may prove more satisfactory for your work than block 34. While we have no information as to how soon the Public Service Hall may be vacated, there seems to be every possibility that it will not be so very long.

Subject: Distribution of Electric Fans
Mr. Collins at the Warehouse indicated that I should communicate to you for my desire for fans.
At the beginning of the summer, I requested 4 fans. One has been issued . Our offices are spread over 2/3 of the P.S. Hall. We have 15 desks in use, more or less regularly. In addition to our office, the USO has periodic need for fans which we loan them. Therefore, my estimate of 4 did not seem excessive to me.

Subject: A New Toyland.
Let me call to your attention the fact that a Toyland for children above 5 years of age has been opened by Community Activities, Children's Department, in Public Service Hall 40. Children may go there and play games under supervision. You will do the parents of your block a favor if you call this to their atten¬tion. In case younger children go, an adult should attend them.

Subject: Transfer of Piano to USO
I have your memorandum about the piano for the USO. There certainly is great need for a piano there. I am very happy to have the piano transferred to Community Activities Section for the use of USO. However, before we complete the transfer, I would like to consult with Norman Nishimoto with reference to Orchestra's use of this piano. After I see him, I will communicate with you.
The first condition laid down in your memorandum is not entirely acceptable to me, although I do not feel there will be any serious problem resulting from it. As I indicated to you earlier, I have no desire to own a piano for the purpose of indiscriminate lending. I would regard this piano as belonging to the equipment of the USO. Only on rare occasions would I consider lending it. Therefore, I do not wish the Education Section to regard us as an easy way out for the Education Section whenever and whatever requests came for the use of a piano. I think you can see ray point.

Subject: Hours at the Teen-Age Club, PSH 19
At the present time the Teen-Age Club is open four night each week, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The group which attended has been consistently small and engage in table games and in informational dancing. Since the groups is small, since it meets regularly and since it is not exclusively a dance the committee felt it was not necessary to issue a dance permit for each separate night. 
Mr. Vance Martin of junior High School and Mrs. Mary Saito, 14-6-E are supervisors to the group. Mrs. Saito is present whenever the club is open. This memorandum is given you for your information and for such instruction you wish to give your men.

Russell Sage Foundation, and Educational Agency, will make a photographic history of hand-craft and art activities of Rohwer, according to plans submitted to Community Activities Section by Mr. Allan Eaton, Director of the Department of Art and Social Work. The foundation was prepared to pay all expenses for shipping art objects to New York in return for photographing. However, plans have been arranged to have Mr. Paul Page Faris of Hendrix College come to this center to do the photographic work.
A local committee composed of Isamu Sugimoto, Henry Sugimoto, Paul Yakura, and S. Uno. With the help of many other artists are planning a center wide art and handicraft exhibit July 21-22 in connection with the visit of Mr. Faris. During the exhibit representative pieces of every variety of art will be photographed by Mr. Faris for the Russell Sage Foundation. The exhibit will include every kind of creative hand work, including, paintings, sculpture, carving, stagecraft, stone-polishing, kobu, hand-made furniture, embroidery, weaving, flower-arranging, tsunami, and ornamental writing.
This, perhaps, will be the last and the biggest art exhibit yet held in Rohwer.
A committee composed of center artists and teachers will meet Friday evening, 7:30 PM to make detailed plans. Exhibitors will be expected to label their works with name, address, and title. A copy of this label should be given the exhibit committee or the block manager. Block managers and secretaries will assist in securing interest and in labeling same

Dear Friend:
You are one of the friends who made it possible for the people of this center to enjoy a fine Christmas. You made this possible by your generosity, kindness, and thoughtfulness, and in spite of the fact that these people are living an abnormal life in an abnormal community.
You are one of the friends who brought joy and renewed faith to these people. There were 204 of you, organizations and individuals, in 23 states in the Union. And you sent in, all told, approximately 5,000 gifts of articles and 23 monetary donations.
The money WAS used for freight and express charges, gifts, and incidental expenses. The articles of gifts were divided into groups according to sex and age. Then a corps of volunteers, more than a hundred of then in all, worked day and night to wrap them and tag them with the names of children. Finally they were distributed to each of the 33 blocks in the center.
Twelve organizations and agencies cooperated to stage the Christmas celebrations. They were: Rohwer Federated Christian Church, Catholic church, Buddhist church, schools, PTA, Block managers, Community Activities section. Social Welfare section, Red Cross, YMCA, Boy and Girl Scouts, and the community newspaper.
Sixty Christmas trees, cut and brought in by Boy Scouts from a hill, some miles away, were distributed to residential blocks, auditorium, hospital, schools, and administration buildings.
An all-center Christmas program was, held on the night of December 23 in the auditorium, which was filled to overflowing with more than 1300 people. On Christmas Eve, Santa Claus had a busy time, as he appeared at the parties held in each block and distributed the gifts that you donated. The Yuletide celebrations came to a windup on Christmas night, when the Christian Sunday schools presented their programs.
We are grateful to you for the part you played in making the Christmas season the success that it was. Certainly, it might have been a dull one for our 250O youngsters, had it not been for your generosity. For that, and for the loving kindness that prompted your action, please accept the thanks of the local Christmas committee and of each of the 6500 residents of Rohwer Relocation Center.
You will be interested in the enclosed account of. a Christmas Eve party, written by a resident.
Gratefully yours,
Rohwer Community Christmas Committee

Mr. Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor, Community Activities, Rohwer Relocation Center, McGehee, Arkansas.
Dear Sir:
Thank you very much for the letter which I received this afternoon. I have been advised that three slides and a set of swings have been shipped to you from New Orleans. There are several items such as trapeze bars, rings etc. which are being held up pending a priority number. I wonder if you might check into this and see if you can get a number on these items thru the relocation authority. I understand that these can be had where the equipment is to be used in the center.
I have just returned to Hattiesburg from a trip along the East coast, I talked to hundreds of people regarding the problems of the Japanese American group and I can say that things are certainly looking brighter everywhere I want. While in Washington I met Mr. Myer for the first time and had a very enjoyable talk with him.
At this time I cannot say when I will be able to come to Rohwer but I certainly hope that it will be soon. I am in receipt of a letter from Chaplain George Aki this date. I believe you met him on the occasion of my last visit there. He was transferred to Fort Mcllnd. Alabama some weeks ago where there are some 1000 Japanese Americans in training, is you know there was a little trouble over there sometime ago but Chaplain Aki says that things are much better now although he has many of the Kibeis in to see him with their troubles. Knowing the chaplain as I do I am sure that he will be able to do a lot of good with these men.
I expect to go there very soon and hope to be able to give you a first hand report when I next see you.
With kindest regards, I am,
Earl Finch

Gentlemen:
We are forwarding to you via freight this date an end table for your US0.
We have had considerable difficulty getting material for the trapeze bars & rings. May I suggest that you see if you can secure iron pipe thru your procurement office for this purpose and send us the memo on cost of same. Will forward funds for the purchase of see-saw boards and other items of this nature that you may want for the playground. Just let us know what the items are and the cost of each.
I will visit both Jerome and Rohwer on the week end of May 20th & 21st and I sincerely hope to see all of my friends there on those days. Mr. Harter, director of the USO here will also be with me at that time.
With kindest personal regards, I am.
Very sincerely,
Earl M. Finch

My dear Mr. Erb:
I'm writing you for suggestions about camping for our scouts this summer.
As you know, we have three troups of rather enthusiastic scouts. They are more than ordinarily interested in summer camps. Without consulting them I am writing to ask your opinion about the matter. Are there regular scout camps in our area or in the areas nearby where it would be possible for us to join other scouts in summer camp activities? I recognize this matter is not simple and that it is not controlled by our wishes. Nevertheless, I entertained hope that the young American Scouts here may have some of the oppor¬tunities which are available to other scouts.
We will appreciate any suggestion that you can give concerning this matter.
Sincerely yours,
Nat R. Griswold Supervisor

Dear Mr. Finch:
The occasional chairs, the sofas, and lamps arrived in excellent condition. We had them for use Saturday night.
We wish to thank you. If it is possible to get word to some of the boys of the 442nd Combat Team, will you extend our deep appreciation?

Mr. R.D. Johnston, our project director, advised me to write you concerning some willow being grown on your project which might be available to us for basket weaving.
Do you hare considerable quantity of willow for this purpose? Under what condition we be allow to come to gather the same? What would you advise in reference to this matter?
We are conducting classes in basketry for our women during the summer and need additional materials. Any help you can give will be appreciated.

Dear Mr. Harder:
Thank you for your efforts to get us admitted into the State Tournament. We felt certain that you would get some objections.
However, we are certain that your discussion of the matter has furthered our cause. All that people do to disseminate the truth about our people does good. In case you are able to bring the champion teams down, we will be very happy. We certainly can assist in the expenses to the extent of $30.00 per team. In case the players are here for a meal, we will be happy to entertain them in our simple way.
Thank you again for your courtesies. Cordially yours,

MEMORANDUM
February 1, 1945
To:	Mr. William M. Beasley
Principal, High School
Subject: Exchange of Chairs at the USO
In accord with your memorandum of January 31 we exchanged Jerome-type folding chairs for the brown auditorium chairs which had been loaned to the USO subject to recall upon demand. We found 94 brown chairs at the USO. We took these to the auditorium and in their place we set up in the USO 94 of the other type chair. Forty-four of these latter were taken out of the auditorium and 50 out of those in our keep¬ing. We did this at the moment for fear we did not have enough sound chairs to replace the number in the USO.
Would you like for us to put in the remaining chairs which you placed in our care in the auditorium or would you prefer that we keep them for exchange for brown chairs at other places in the center?

Our records show that Dr. J. B . Hunter , former chief of Community Services signed a receipt for 140 chairs from the Senior High School, subject to recall upon demand. I am at the point that I find it necessary to sret together about 200 of the brown auditorium folding chairs.

Since my conversation with you I have talked with Rev. Hirabayashi. He thinks it is unwise to continue meeting in PSH 6. Today he and I found a location. It will be necessary to do some repair work and to secure some furniture before it can be used by the group. Therefore, Mr. Hirabayashi would like to meet this Saturday in PSH 6. I told him I would communicate his wishes to you. He would like for you to tell the caretaker about this plan. After this Saturday they will be able to fleet in this new place.

Dear Tommy:
I assume that you are the T.D. Scott whom we know a few years ago at Henderson. We were referred to you by Mr. Cuthbortson when we inquired for a good dance orchestra.
One of the High School Club in this center wish to promote a distinctive dance late this month or early in May. They wish to secure good orchestra from the outside. We wonder if you could help us.
Could you bring your orchestra down some Friday? If so, what would be the terms? How many would you have in your orchestra?
Personally, I think playing here would be a novel experience for your group. We certainly would appreciate anything you could do to lift out of its humdrum the life of the young people here. We hope we may hear from you soon.
Cordially,
Nat R. Griswold

After conference with both block managers we have worked out the following arrangement with reference to furnishing you space nearer the center of the community. Since the Boy Scouts had previously received official permission to use Public Service Hall 34 and since they now have funds to install a partition, it seems best to let them proceed.
We have cleared matters so that as soon as Public Service Hall 33 is vacated by Cooperative Enterprises you will be permitted to use one half of that hall. All things considered block 33 may prove more satisfactory for your work than block 34. While we have no information as to how soon the Public Service Hall may be vacated, there seems to be every possibility that it will not be so very long.

Attention: Mr. J.B. Hunter
Dear Mr. Johnston:
Among those coming to your Center from Jerome will be many who have been members of such organizations as Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, USO, Red Cross, PTA, etc. It is our understanding that the Community Activities Section at Jerome is developing plans for transfer of membership of Jerome residents to similar organizations at the Project of destination.
I hope that you have developed plans for the various organizations at your Center to participate in welcoming newcomers. Each organization should also make a special effort to enroll, as a group, those who were members of a comparable organization at Jerome.
Sincerely yours,
/s/ John H. Provinse, Chief

Dear Mr. Griswold:
Are you the Griswold that I was in school with at Henderson?
I am writing this for Mr. Manning in order that you will get the information that you asked for in your letter.
Believe that our team will get in there about 1:00 for the game on the 2th and the boys will perhaps want to head on back soon after the game is over. Most teams want to do that. The game time of 2:00 is all right.

You will have to furnish both umpires as we are unable to bring one.
Yours very truly,
W.J. Whitthorne

Dear Sir:
Thank you very much for your recent invitation to attend the dedication of the childrens playground. I regret that I will be unable to come to Rohwer on Tuesday as I have an engagement in New Orleans on that day, I will come to Rohwer within the very near future however and I am looking forward to seeing the playground at that time.
While visiting Rohwer on my last trip, I was the guest of a young man named Richard Arao in Block 38. Some time ago I had a letter from him with reference to lounges for the dormitory for the older men. There are none of the lounges to be had used in this section but I may be able to locate two spring filled new lounges, These cost about $80 each and retail in the stores for $145.00, in other words I would be glad to give them the advantage of my wholesale cost on these items. He also mentions a wheel chair for one of the men there who needs one badly, this is also a very difficult thing to find. Please advise Richard that I shall be happy to contribute towards the cost of a chair if one should be found elsewhere, meanwhile I will continue to be on the lookout for one here.
If there is ever anyting that you know of that I can do, please do not hesitate to call on me,
With kindest personal regards, I am.
Very sincerely,

Dear Mr. Griswold:
One nice thing about the Denver conference was the oppor-tunity it gave each one of us to know the other fellows. This ought to be a real help in solving some problems which cannot otherwise be handled where personal contact has not been established.
On this occasion I hope that you can be of real assistance to the Tule Lake Community Activities Section. We have been trying for months to get a supply of hardwood through regular Procurement channels. Requests were sent both to Jerome and Rowher for the shipment of some of the hardwood which grows right outside the project; however, we were informed that it could not be secured.
Only yesterday I talked to a couple of new arrivals from Jerome and it was their opinion that if I wrote to you, you might be able to obtain enough hardwood for our carving classes. I am sure that you have a similar activity at Rowher, and if the leaders of wood carving classes could select some pieces for us and ship them, we shall be glad to reimburse for the charges. I shall not specify sizes other than to ask for a variety which your instructor should be able to select.
I hope that you had as good a time at Denver as I did. I am already looking forward to our next conference, and Denver is O.K. with me.
Sincerely yours,
Lorne Huycke
Supervisor of Community Activities

TO HOM IT MY CONCERN:
It is a privilege to recommend Kyuji Hozaki who has been directly under my supervision since
May 1944.
Mr. Hozaki Is a pleasing person in appearance and manner. He retains remarkably his youthful appearance and pleasantness. He has a fine sensitiveness of other people's feelings and always has a soft answer. In fact he frequently undergoes personal inconveniences rather than embarrass other people either by asking a favor or pointing out an error.
Mr. Hozaki Is devotedly religious in the best sense. He has a deep personal faith which gives him assurance even In difficult situations. His religion seems to be the source of genuine optimism, He is always ready to believe the best.
Mr. Hozaki and his wife have maintained a fine relationship to their two sons In the army. They transmitted to them their own religious faith and have had them attend sunday school and church. Letters from one of the boys wounded evidence a deep appreciation of this parental care.
As a worker Mr. Hozaki is always ready to help in any enterprise. He is not afraid to get his hands dirty or to undertake hard jobs. He consistantly works overtime and does what needs to be done without being told. He is systematic in planning his work and keeping records.
Mr. Hozaki has been a good citizen of Rohwer Community. He is one of the most active men in every community-wide undertaking. He has been an officer of

Dear Fred:
The soldiers at Camp Savage made a donation of $100.00 to the children of the young people of our Center. They requested that we purchase something for a large number can enjoy. Our committee have decided to get a piano, if that is possible for a modest amount.
We would like for you to inquire for us among your people whether there is an used piano available. We feel that it may be possible to get a fairly good piano from an individual who may be interested in this project. We doubt wwhether a dealer would give us a very good piano for this amount. We would not want to use the money of the soldiers for worthless instrument.
We will appreciate anything you can do.
Cordially yours,

Dear Fred,
Thank you for your efforts to find us a piano. We will be glad to hear if you were successful. However, we may use the $100 the boys at Camp Savage for something to be used by the younger children. If that does not seem likely we will find a satisfactory piano for that amount. In any event we appreciate your friendly assistant and will be glad to hear if there is a piano available.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Haack:
For a long time I have entertained the idea of having Miss Kansuma, the dancer who appeared at Hollister, to appear in special performances before college audiences. The favorable impression she made at Hollister and her happy experience there have encouraged me to push the matter.
Would it be possibIe to get colleges in and around St. Louis to book her for engagements? In case we booked her in a number of places we could have printed annotated programs with her picture and so forth.
I have talked with her in general about the matter. She is decidedly interested. We have not gone so far as to discuss financial considerations. However, with her interest in the whole matter, I am certain we could make that part reasonable and reachable, especially if we had a number of schools near together.
Will you let me have your opinion on this immediately? As soon as we develop other details here we will let you know.
Sincerely yours,

Dear Lieutenant:
We were glad to have the boys from your battalion visit us in tie past week-end. We wondered if it would be possible to pay us a visit and at the same time furnish us some competition in sports in September 1st and 2nd.
We would be glad if you would bring your hardball team. We will have to fill in the gap with substitutes but we would hope to make the game interesting for you.
Our people enjoy boxing too. However, we have no organized team in this sport. Would it be possible to bring your team and arrange exhibition matches for our audience? We might have 2 or 3 boys who would be willing to participate. For the sake of competition, it might be desirable to divide the entire group into two teams, red and green, or some other designation.
If this is at all possible, our Athletic Supervisor, George Suzuki, could send you at an early date, further details about the schedule and participants. Will you let us have a reply from you concerning this matter?

Dear Mr. Letson:
Miss Kansuma is visiting one of the western centers just now. Perhaps it will be the first of the year before we can plan with her with ref¬erence to visits with her to colleges in Arkansas.
Our group enjoyed the conference in Conway. We greatly appreciate the friends which we have in this state which officially has been unfriendly towards us.
Sincerely yours,

Dear Rev. McConnell:
Let me thank you for your thoughtful remembrance of  us as evidenced by your check to our Christmas party. We have received gifts from many parts of the United States and now have close to 3,000 items. Since we have approximately 2,700 children, this is not too many. The cash is exceedingly useful since we have to take care of cost for transportation, wrapping, as well as to purchase some nuts. It now appears we will have a Merry Christmas in our center.
Cordially yours,

Dear Mr. Griswold:
Enclosed find a small check to help on Christmas party at Rohwer. Sorry to have made it out to you - it had been some time since I read your letter, but I'm sure you can endorse it to Mrs. Muraoka - haven't another blank check in the house.
Two of my women's organizations gave me $2 each and the SS may make up the extra $1 - if not I'm glad to contribute it.
Hope you have a grand party.
Cordially,

Mr. Earl M. Finch P. 0. Box 504 Hattiesburg, Mississippi
Dear Mr. Finch:
The question has arisen with reference to title of various items donated for use in the center. Something needs to be done to clarify the issues.
In general, as you know, non-expendable property donated to occupants of a government reserve become the property of the government when it is set up in that reserve, unless there is in writing agreement to that contrary. Mr. Moulton, Chief of Community management, after consultation with our property officer, requested that I write about this matter. I think that a letter from you indicating your wishes about the disposal of property given by you and boys at Camp Shelby would enable our attorney to put into legal form those wishes so that there would be no question as to their final control.
I think of the following specific item about which you might wish to designate some plan of disposal.
Old Man's Home, block 39: 1 couch, 4 chairs. Children's Playground, east of auditorium: 3 slides, 1 metal swing - 3 seats, 8 travel rings with chain, 4 trapeze swings with chains. USO, Block 48: 2 couches, 4 occasional chairs, 2 table lamps, 2 smoking stands.
You understand, I am sure, that our property officer has no disposition personally to label this property government- owned. But he has no alternative unless he has on his record legal contrary instructions. A letter from you will enable us to make out a simple document at which we could forward you and a copy of which could be retained by us.
Sincerely yours,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities

Dear Mr. Griswold,
Your letter of April 4th to Mr. Bankston has been referred to me, and I wish we were able to supply you with an orchestra.
As you know, we have a Navy unit here, and members of the band and orchestra have not been permitted to play out of town engagements.
Yours truly,
L. 0. Wallick Director of Band

Dear Paul:
I am sending a letter to Allen Eaton about you
and the photographing of the art objects at the center. I told him you would send examples of your work and information
about your equipment and supplies needed. His address I am giving below.
Because of relocation, time is important. In fact I am asking Mr. Eaton to name a date prior to July 12. I am urging that he come. He perhaps will wire me about further insturctions. I hope you can send by airmail your materials and your letter.     Sincerely,

AIR MAIL
Mr. Nat R. Griswold U.S. Department of the Interior War Relocation Authority Relocation Branch McGehee, Arkansas
Dear Mr. Griswold:
The enclosed letter to Mr. Faris will explain itself and I know you will cooperate with me to the full. I will do whatever you feel I should do in the matter of arranging finances.
Because of your great interest in the situation and our mutual desire to get the best possible record out of Rohwer, I hope you will let me know of anything that I can do to help either with the work of Mr. Faris or others if you decide to bring them in.
It is utterly impossible for me to get to the camp as early as you mentioned. In fact, I do not know that I can make it, but I should try very hard to do so in August if you thought that would contribute anything to our plan.
I would so much like to meet the artists and craftsmen and others interested in the matter in camp, but I cannot today write more definitely.
I would be very glad to have you arrange with the Buddhist minister to take some things if you think it would help us to get the record. However, I have limited my correspondence to Mr. Faris thinking it best to give him a chance to see what he can do.
I wonder if you will get in touch with him at once, allowing me to pay for any telephones, telegrams, or other expenses, so that if there should be anyone that he wishes to get before July 12 he will have time for that.
I am not attempting to check over the list of artists and craftsmen
Nat R. Griswold -2- July 3, 1945 that I had formerly because I know there have been many changes. If it will help the situation at all I shall be glad to forward you a check for Mr. Faris or handle it in any way you suggest. I have given him the best idea I could a to what subjects to get, but undoubtedly you will think of others equally good or better, and I wish you would add them to his list. Do let me know of anything that I can do from this end. Sincerely, Allen Eaton AE/SS Enclosure

My dad’s condition remains much as it has been but his proceeding, on the assumption he’ll be there this weekend.

However, I wish you’d write me how to get in touch with you if necessary.

I’d probably leave here Saturday about noon. Haven’t checked yet.

Paul

Dear Paul:
I have verified only one thing about our exhibit and photographing the art objects. We will not able to hold the exhibit this weekend, July 14, I5.

Dear Nat:
It's only for the best that the exhibit couldn't be held this week end, because I would not have been able to get there.
My dad remains critically ill in St. Vincent's. We took him for the second time on last Wednesday. It is now necessary to have a nurse with him 24 hours a day. My sister came from Kansas City and I also was there from Saturday night till last night. It's been quite a strain.
Whatever the outcome of my dad's illness, I presume that I will be able to come down the week end of the 21st. I hope that anything that can be done to improve chances for some nice garden shots will be done, though gardens aren't exactly things that you can run according to dates.
A telegram from Eaton today says he's leaving it all up to you and me. I know that some of the Japanese can keep us straight on making things accurate from their point of view. Eaton will want pretty full information about the subjects pictured, so we'll need some one that can get it for us. I'm hoping the Sugimotos are still there, though I heard they probably are not.
Regards to Mrs. Griswold, and I'll be expecting further word when you know more about the 21st.
Paul

Dear Paul:
Our committee met this morning and made some decisions with reference to our art exhibit and your work of photographing, mainly our discussions was about the exhibit plans for which are preliminary to the photographing.
We definitely set July 21-22 as the time for the exhibit. The exhibit will include all types of art and crafts represented in this center, including painting, sculpture, carving, stagecraft, stone polishing, kobu, hand-made furniture, embroidery, weaving, flower arranging, tsunami, and ornamental writing. It is our hope that we will be able to arrange a place to photograph the art objects in the auditorium where the exhibit will be. Before you arrive we will expect to have listed other objects of photography, gardens, interiors, artists.
As to your train schedule here. You can take the 6:20 PM out of Little Rock Friday evening arrive in McGehee at 8:15 PM. Your return train leaves McGehee at 8:30 PM and arrives in Little Rock about 11:00 PM. This would give you two full days, though it would be rather strenuous on you. We will keep you informed as to our plans.
Your letter came today. Be assured that we think of you during these difficult days. The last days of loved ones, though expected, can never be welcome. We remember your father with the greatest appreciation of the quality of your mind and life.
Sincerely yours,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor

Dear Mr. Eaton,
We are sending a copy of the letter sent to Mr. Faris concerning the Art Exhibit and picture making. There	seems to be genuine enthusiasm for the exhibit. I feel we will get quite satisfactory results. We will let you know new developments.

Dear Mr. Griswold:
I am sure you must know how disappointing it was to me not to be able to get to the exhibition but I am earnestly hoping that Mr. Faris will get a good record of it and I have asked Mr. Yuasa to go down to help in any way that he can.
I do appreciate your great interest in this project and your fine and persistent cooperation with me. We shall try to get the best possible record of the activities and the arts at Rohwer and I am asking Mr. Yuasa to make some connection in the camp, if he can, with persons who may be able to continue this interest as long as the camp is open, in order that we may make as complete a record as possible of the handicrafts there.
Is there any way to get a list of a few of the best things that have been made at Rohwer and may be taken away? Please let me know the names arid addresses of these and I will, be glad to follow them up. Or ask Mr. Yuasa to help you in any way he can.
I remember a long time ago that I received for examination some very excellent things in weaving. I hope that you may know, or that some of your associates may know, how we could get hold of a few examples of this weaving to photograph and possibly later to exhibit, but in any case to photograph and we could return anything borrowed reasonably soon to the owner.
All of your suggestions have been so very helpful. I hope you will make more if you see any way in which I may cooperate more fully with you.
Sincerely, Allen Eaton
AE:E

Please feel free to have Mr. Faris come back if it will help. With all you and your committee have done, we must do all possible to get the hit record.

Dear Mr. Eaton:
This will bring you up to date on our photographing enterprise.
Mr. and Mrs. Faris reached the camp about 7:30 Saturday
July 21. We looked over the exhibit and spotted pieces until 10:00 PM. On Sunday we photographed all day until 10:30 PM. Monday we worked until 7:45 PM. Altogether he took 120 different shots. Mrs. Faris makes the notes for him and interviews the artists. While we made remarkable coverage during the 2 days of his visit, we are planning for him to finish up on Sunday July 28.
We did representative pieces of various artists here, gardens, interiors and artists at work. Gardens are below standard this year and you need not expect too such. While I remarked in an earlier letter Mr. Faris is nonprofessional, watching his work convinces me that he is professional in his method and technique. He really expects to follow this line, possibly professionally.
We will be able to furnish you the name and addresses of some persons from whom you may get additional photographs. Our reports officer, Mr. Austin Smith, suggested to me that you to the WRA office in Washington and get permission to examine their files of negatives. The WRA photographer, as you know, has covered all the centers rather carefully. It is possible you will find some negatives covering material you seek.
While I do not know your understanding of Mr. Faris, I do know he is in need of replacements of materials, films, paper and chemicals. You may be able to help him at this point. He certainly worked with great enthusiasm and I believe he will have excellent results.
Through an unfortunate accident Dr. Yuasa reached the center
Mr. Allen Eton-2-July 26, 1945 just as the exhibit was being dismantled. However he did excellent work in talking to artists and getting stories. His suggestions were very valuable. Sincerely yours, Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities NRG:mn

Dear Mr. Eaton:
I had Mr. & Mrs. Faris for another week-end July 28-29. They followed up suggestions left by Dr. Yuasa.
Two matters we would like to clear with you: possibility of the center residents securing prints of the pictures you have had made and the expenses incurred by us in collecting and making pictures.
The residents naturally desire greatly to have pictures of their own work. They would like to know if the material is to be published in a booklet or a magazine. If so, they wish the information necessary to secure copies. This matter is complicated by the fact that many will be leaving the center within two weeks. Should I make the list of the names of the artists with their new address for your file? Any advice you have in this matter will be appreciated. The whole group certainly cooperated enthusiastically and would appreciate greatly some souvenir or a pictorial account of the exhibit. Incidentally, there were 527 entries in the exhibit and 135 exhibitors. A gross total of 4158 people visited the exhibit.
As to the expenses incurred by us are listed below. We feel that they are legitimate. The first item was for additional workers necessary for preparing the exhibit tables and returning same, collecting entries and returning them. We used eight local high school students for greater part of two days. It was necessary to drive thirteen miles to McGehee for the
Mr. Allen Eaton - 2 - 8/4/45 Faris' and Dr. Yuasa. For this I used my personal car. The WRA furnishes room to visitors at the nominal fee, 50¢ a night. This we paid for Mr. & Mrs. Faris. Workers for collecting material $10.88 Room for Faris' 2.50 4 round trips to McGehee 3.60 Phone call to Mr. Faris 1.33 Total 18.31 I presume that Dr. Yuasa has reported to you and that Mr. Faris will communicate in some detail about the pictures.

AIR MAIL
Mr. Nat R. Griswold
Supervisor of Community Activities
War Relocation Branch
McGehee, Arkansas
Dear Mr. Griswold:
Thanks for your good letters including the one of August 4 just arrived. I am enclosing a check for $18.31 to take care of the expenses listed on the second page of your letter.
I was in New England for about ten days and since returning have talked with Dr. Yuasa over the phone and have filed the application for photographic materials which I hope will bear fruit shortly so that I can send them to Mr. Faris.
I deeply appreciate all that you, Mr. Faris and the Committee have done to help us get a good record of handicrafts at Rohwer, and I am anxiously awaiting some of the prints.
Dr. Yuasa spoke of great appreciation of both your own cooperation and that of Mr. and Mrs. Faris, and we shall have a meeting shortly to see what else we can do to make the record more satisfactory and complete.
About the photographs for the exhibitors, will you please tell them that we are at present making a great effort to get the record and cannot say at this time how they will be used al¬though we feel that they certainly can be used to good advantage in the future.
About furnishing prints, I would like to do all we can to help the exhibitors get a record of their work. I wonder if you will take this matter up with Mr. Faris and see what he thinks we can and should do. I have not yet completed the financial arrangements with him, feeling sure that this could be left to his suggestions after he had done the work.
We might do one of two things. If the cost of the prints is not too heavy, we might present them to the exhibitors, but I have not had any price from Mr. Faris for prints, and I know the paper is hard to get. If we couldn't manage this then, if paper is to be had, we surely ought to let the exhibitors have prints at a nominal price. The question of what we can
Mr. Nat R. Griswold -2- August 6, 1945 do is related to the whole cost of the undertaking. Certainly your own bill is very small and I feel at a loss today to say what we can do other than to assure you that we will try to do the right thing. I will ask Mr. Yuasa's Judgment on this, but I feel that you and Mr. Faris are in the best position to suggest what we should do. If Mr. Faris has the stock, of course it would be best to make the prints and tell them at the center, but if there should be a delay on that then we would have to mail them to the respective addresses. It is possible that when I get my set of prints that I could spare some of them to be distributed by you while the exhibitors are there. Whether we present the prints or they are purchased at a nominal price, it should be with the understanding that they are personal and not to be used for publication unless we specifically release them. This I think everyone would agree. I think if you can make a list of the names of the artists with their new addresses for my file, it would be useful regardless of what we do about the prints. I would probably like to write to a good many of them later for information concerning themselves and their experience, and of course let them know of any use to which any of the pictures may be put. One thing that makes the problem a little puzzling to me is the large number of entries which of course was responsible for a very successful show, but which also poses an item of some expense if prints are to be furnished of all the subjects which Mr. Faris has taken. My object in asking you to talk it over with Mr. Faris is that the paper situation may effect what we can do and when. Also I felt that asking Mr. Faris to make these extra prints should bring him some return above any other arrangements which we work out. Please count on me for any possible cooperation and let me know as soon as convenient your own judgment and wishes in the matter. I shall be writing you at a later time about possiblilties of making the report from Rohwer as complete and effective as possible. Certainly your own devotion to the undertaking and the fine cooperation which you have had deserve the best record we can make of it. If there are any other expenses please do not hesitate to let me know. Sincerely, AE/SS Allen Eaton Enclosure

Dear Paul:
The photographs arrived in fine shape. All of us are elated over the results. I took Mr. Usui's print to him immediately. He was quite beside himself with appreciation. You will perhaps hear from his son.
As you remember all of the persons having exhibits were interested in getting prints of your pictures. A letter from Mr. Eaton indicated that he was applying for additional material for your use. Assuming you can get the paper, the steering committee here agrees that we would like one print of all the subjects taken. The 5 x 4 size will be satisfactory. We are willing to pay whatever you find it possible to make these for. In case any exhibitor do not want their copy the members of the committee will be glad to take it.
Eaton suggested he might be able to pay the costs of these prints. But, we are willing to go ahead without waiting for his decision. Of course, people leaving will want their prints as soon as possible. However, we realize that there is a limit to your time and material.
You may not be able to fill our order, but we thought we would write and inquire.
Cordially yours,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities

Dear Sugimoto:
We are enclosing pictures made by Mr. Faris with his compliments to you. We hope they serve as a pleasant reminder of one of the last major activities of yours in this center.
Mr. Faris has sent you copies of most of your shots. So exhibitors are now able to have souvenirs of our exhibit.
I presume you have conferred with Mr. Eaton and know of the progress of his project with Mr. Faris. He seemed pleased over the prospect in my last letter from him. Faris certainly worked diligently and intelligently.
We wish for you and your family all the good things you so richly deserve. If we can be of any help please let us know.
Cordially yours,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities

Mr. Paul Page Feris Hendrix College Conway, Arkansas Dear Mr. Faris:
We are enclosing a check for $60.75. This is to pay you for picture as follows:
71 prints (5"X4") received $17.75 132 prints (5"x4") on order $33.00 10 prints (5"x4") on order $10.00
We are also enclosing a list of our order of 132 (5"x4") prints and 10 8"X10". The second list as indicated is for 26 prints (5"x4") to be given to as many artists with the compliments of Mr. Eaton. I assume from, your card that this is an order and that you can send Mr. Eaton for a bill of the same. We made this list of selections rather carefully from the list of a total of 135 exhibitors. Most of the persons to whom these will go have ordered additional print from you. For purposes of identification will you please mark the negative number on the back of each of the complimentary prints.

This order is a slight evidence of our appreciation of the work you did and of what the pictures represent.
Sincerely yours,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities

Mr. Paul Page Faris Hendrix College
Conway, Arkansas
Dear Paul,
Mrs. Saga was in the hospital and failed to get her order in for an enlargement of her flower arrangement, C-12. We think this is the correct number. However, Mrs. Faris no doubt has the data. It is a picture of
the flower arranged in a long wooden inlaid bowl, handmade. Mrs. Saga would like to have two (8 x 10).
With all the school activities you may not be able to fill this order. If you can do so, please send them C.O.D. and include postage charges.
Hope you have had good word from Eaton. You certainly succeeded in getting a group of unusual pictures both as to subject matter and quality.
Sincerely,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities

Mr. Nathaniel R. Griswold Community Activities Supervisor Rohwer Relocation Center McGehee, Arkansas
Dear Mr. Griswold:
You will probably wonder why you have not had from me of late a line of appreciation for the really fine joby you and Mr. Faris did in connection, with the photographing of art activities at Rohwer.
The explanation is that soon after you had finished your job, I took my vacation and visited five of the Relocation Camps in the West arranging as, well as I could for records of their activities. I can promise you that something interesting will work out of these efforts, but nothing can quite match the fine job at Rohwer.
I shall be writing Mr. Faris shortly. If you should see him please explain my delay.
As I write I have two thoughts in mind; one, the importance of giving prints to at least some of the exhibitors in the Rohwer show. I was not in a position to authorize thanking of so many prints especially when I had this western trip with indefinite expenses ahead of me. Therefore I left it to you and Mr. Faris to see if you could work out some plan, and I would appreciate it if you would let me know what if anything was done. If you did not work out something and wish me to take the matter of the cost of prints up with him, I shall do so.
The other thing I have in mind is to see if we cannot add still a few more subjects to our fine collection of photographs. It may seem to you impossible to do it, but what you already have done has made me so happy about your accomplishments that I should not ask for anything else. However, I am studying the matter with a view to get some additional things in later to make up for what we cannot get in other camps. Therefore if you have in mind anything of special merit which you think Mr. Faris might get, I shall write him and do my best to work out an arrangement by which he can make the record as complete as possible.
Mr. Nathaniel R. Griswold -2- October 9, 1945 Without going into details, I wish you would follow up on inquiry for me. Did you remember the dwarf chrysanthemums of which we have an excellent photograph but the legend says that those plants will be in blossom in October? I should certainly love to have a photograph of these dwarf plants in blossom and pssibly one which would include the grower. I wonder if you would not know now almost offhand of other subjects which you would like to have taken. If so, would you let me know so that I can see what might be worked out with Mr. Faris. The officials in Washington and also the members of the staffs in the different camps seem to value highly the kind of records we are trying to get of the arts, and I am confident that good use can be made of them. My special concern at this time i to get as good a record as posible, for it will not be many days until the opportunity is gone. Thank you again for your very fine cooperation. Let me know what you think we should do about giving prints to exhibitors and if there are other subjects which you would like to have taken. Sincerely, Allen Eaton/s/ AE/SS

Mr. Allen Eaton
Russell Sage Foundation
130 East Twenty-second Street
New York 10, New York
Dear Mr. Eaton:
I was glad to have your letter of October 9 concerning the pictures of art activities in Rohwer.
Concerning the first question about complimentary prints to the exhibitors in Rohwer. On the basis of your earlier suggestion Faris made 26 (4"X5") prints which we gave complimentary. It was our understanding that Faris would enclose the cost of these in his bill to you. When you recall that there were 134 separate exhibitors, you will understand we presented pictures with your compliments to relatively few.
Concerning additional pictures. I will follow up immediately your inquiry about the dwarf chrysanthemum. Last year Mr. Tsunekawa had some prize winners. Likewise I will review immediate possibilities of other interesting shots, though the population at this center and its culture are evaporating rapidly.
You will hear from us again.
Cordially yours,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities

Dear Mr. Finch:
We are in the process of finishing our work here. Our
population is below the 2,000 mark. We expect to have the entire group out by the first of December. It is a difficult job and one can not always feel happy in it. Undoubtedly adjustments and integration will be difficult for numbers of our families. But in no forseeable time ahead will matters be easy for them. In fact, the quicker they start the sooner will they be able to find a happy life again. We will do what we can.
Since our population is leaving rapidly, we would like instructions from you about the shipment of the playground equipment - slides, trapeze bars, swings. While I have some workers I expect to dismantle this equipment next week. However, there need be no particular rush on your part about shipping instructions. We will simply prepare it for shipping and hold for your instructions.
We had the privilege of seeing Mary Nakahara and her mother on the train to California on October 11 after her brother Art was married here on October 10. She is still energetic and high in her praise of you and your work.
Sincerely yours,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities

Dear Paul:
The pictures came in fine shape. I collected the cost and straight a way forgot to send it to you. I am enclosing a check. I had a long letter from Eaton which indicated he wished additional shots. However, he only indicated one specific shot of the tree chrysanthemum in bloom. As far as I found out now, the chrysanthemums are not in full bloom. I will check further on this matter. I am at a complete loss to know what other shots would be valuable. We might take some more of the artists.
All of our residents are planning to leave during November. We only have something less than 2,000 left now. Most everyone is packed or is packing.
We will be delighted to have you and Ann come back to see us. But I am not too enthusiastic about the possibilities of getting worthwhile shots for Eaton. Were you here on a day when a special train leaves, you could get some fine human interest shots and perhaps a story for Ann. If you got a chance come to see us by all means.
Sincerely,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities

Dear Dr. Griswold:
Last week I talked with the president of William Woods College in Fulton, Missouri, about having Miss Kansuma come thwre and appear before the student body in some dances. He told me that he would be glad to have her come and would take care of her expenses and give her an honorarium. Of course I do not know how much that would be, but the occasion would at least get her before one of the very fine bodies of students. If she will agree to go, then I shall endeavor to arrange for her to go to Stevens College and also Christian College in Columbia. If she desires to take her mother along, that will be splendid. Her expenses will be taken care of also. You could have a written interpretation of her dances printed, or I could do it here is she wouod send me the copy.
The attitude outside seems to me to be changing very definitely. Two years ago our International Convention debated a resolution on the Japanese question in real heat, and all that some of us were asking then was that hearing boards be set up to give some a chance to return to civilian employment. At our International Convention in Columbus two weeks ago now a strong resolution was presented asking the Government to restore to the people of Japanese descent in America the same rights that other Americans enjoy, and the motion,or resolution, was adopted without debate. It was really encourageing. I gave the last half of my address to a discussion of the evacuation and what it means in Democratic America, and it was receiced with enthusiasm. In fact I had to stand twice and "take a bow" after I had finished and sat down, believe it or not. It was really a very ordinary address. My work is largely in the field of Peace, but people are eager to learn about the entire Japanese situation in America, so I am having to give a good deal of time to that still.
How is the garden? Did the weeds take It? Did the radishes and late turnips come up, or was it chard that I planted? Has anybody been enjoying the sweep potatoes? I hope so. I miss the garden as much as I "do my office. Who has moved into "our" house?
The address of the President of William Woods College is, Dr. Harlee L. Smith, William Woohs College, Pulton Missouri.
Very sincerelt,
J.B. Hunter

ALLEN EATON, Department Director
June 21, 1945
Mr. Nat R. Griswold Supervisor, Community Activities War Relocation Authority Rohwer Relocation Center McGehee, Arkansas
Dear Mr. Griswold:
I have received both your letter of June 16th and your telegram. I shall try to answer them both herewith.
Tell Mr. Henry Sugimoto to have his boxes sent directly to the New York Church Committee for Japanese Americans, 150 Fifth Avenue, New York City. This is where I am having everything shipped in connection with the photographing and the exhibitions. They will be held until Mr. Sugimoto arrives. If he has arranged to have them shipped collect please notify me so that I can leave money at that office to pay the transportation. The Committee has sufficient room to keep the boxes as long as necessary.
Referring to the photographing of objects at Rohwer, if you have a first class photographer whom we could employ I would be glad to compensate him for his work, and I think I could instruct him as to how to get the best results. If you have such a photographer please send me some samples of his work by airmail, and I can tell at once what to do.
The photographer I have here is a very superior one tut he could not get away from his work here in time. Therefore our first choice would be to have your photographer do the work. If that cannot be arranged then the next best plan would be to have the objects shipped here in which case I would arrange to have them returned within two weeks after receipt of them. If there were some objects belonging to individuals who would be relocated during the time the objects are away I would return them to the new address defraying all expense involved.
I do appreciate the concern which the people have for their handicrafts, but at the moment I see only these two ways out. I hope they will appreciate the situation and will help us to meet it.
	
Referring again to the third paragraph of your letter: point 1- It  seems to me that a week each way via express ought to be sufficient
Mr. Nat R. Griswold - Page 2

allowance for transportation, and with a maximum of two weeks for photographing every thing should be finished, within a month.
Point 2 - As 1 have said, I will return the objects to any address the owner will give me.
Point 3- I would appreciate very much your having owners send anything to me that had been taken out of the camp.
Referring to paragraph four, the sooner the things are sent here the better. This will authorize you to employ anyone who can do the work satisfactorily to you and to know those in the camps who are sending their handicrafts. I would be glad to send you a check in advance for any sum you estimate as needed.
It would be a help to me if you will send as early as possible a list of the types of handicrafts you feel would be available.
I am negotiating with a Japanese photographer in a western camp to do some photographing there but since the plan is not yet worked out I think it would be better if you, your associates, and I work the problems out for Rohwer.
I have known more of Rohwer than any other camp and I am greatly interested in it. I will be glad to make as such of the budget as possible as possible available for getting a good record there.
I know when the things were sent some time ago, because of my absence from the office in the field, there was some delaying their return but I shall be here continuously now until this work is finished. Therefore everything will be photographed as soon as possible and returned promptly.
I feel very confident that you will be able to get excellent subjects and if you have a list of first class things that have been taken from the camp please let me know and I will try to follow them up.
I hope you will assure your associates in the camp that I will give my best cooperation in this important undertaking. Do let me know which plan seems best to you.
Sincerely,
Allen Eaton

Br. Nat R. Griswold,Supervisor, Community Activities, Rohwer Relocation Center, McGehee Arkansas,
Dear Dr. Griswold:
On my recent visit to Rohwer I mentioned to you the favorable attitude of our local paper with regard to Japanese-Americans. You will note by the caption of the attached article something of the way this paper feels on the question.
You should be receiving the furniture for your USO in the next few days. I am afraid that the playground equipment cannot be had right away as it has to be made to order, you may be assured that I will do all that I can to get it right out as soon as possible.
Thank you very much for your invitation to visit Rohwer again, I shall come at the very first opportunity.
Tonight I dropped by one of the largest restaurants in Hattiesburg where I was to speak to a group of our boys that were having a farewell dinner. When I arrived at the restaurant I found that a large group of caucasian soldiers of the 65th Division were also having a party. The two groups decided to consolidate their party, it was a great affair and one that I wish you could have seen. It shows the spirit that exists between our men in uniform and is a forerunner of what we may expect when these men return to take their rightful place as responsible citizens, after the war.
With kindest regards, I am.
Very sincerely,
Earl M. Finch
Whatcha Mean- Land of the Free?
PHILADELPHIA, April 14.—(AP) —Sad but resigned, five Japanese- Americans faced the prospect of becoming government charges to-day—their New Jersey farm jobs gone because of neighbors' pro¬tests.
"It looks," said George Yamamoto, spokesman for the group, "as if we'll have to go back to letting the government feed us. We have no money. We have no income. But those people didn't want us to earn our own living."
The five were brought here by 23 - year - old George Kowalick, Warren county (N. J.) farmer who had employed them, after protest signs were posted, a shack on his farm was burned and neighbors held indignation meetings.
"We feel ashamed," Yamamoto told reporters at a hotel operated by the war relocation authority, "that the government has to feed us. We want to help. But if they won't let us work, we'll just have to go back to that camp.
"We are not mad with those people. We know how they feel. But we are not responsible for what Japan did. We are just Am¬ericans and want to do our part."
The men were held at the Gila river relocation center in Arizona until the Federal Bureau of In¬vestigation certified them as to the United States. Yamamoto previously left a job on a Sussex county, Dela., farm following neighbors' protests.

TO HOM IT MY CONCERN:
It is a privilege to recommend Kyuji Hozaki who has been directly under my supervision since
May 1944.
Mr. Hozaki Is a pleasing person in appearance and manner. He retains remarkably his youthful appearance and pleasantness. He has a fine sensitiveness of other people's feelings and always has a soft answer. In fact he frequently undergoes personal inconveniences rather than embarrass other people either by asking a favor or pointing out an error.
Mr. Hozaki Is devotedly religious in the best sense. He has a deep personal faith which gives him assurance even In difficult situations. His religion seems to be the source of genuine optimism, He is always ready to believe the best.
Mr. Hozaki and his wife have maintained a fine relationship to their two sons In the army. They transmitted to them their own religious faith and have had them attend sunday school and church. Letters from one of the boys wounded evidence a deep appreciation of this parental care.
As a worker Mr. Hozaki is always ready to help in any enterprise. He is not afraid to get his hands dirty or to undertake hard jobs. He consistantly works overtime and does what needs to be done without being told. He is systematic in planning his work and keeping records.
Mr. Hozaki has been a good citizen of Rohwer Community. He is one of the most active men in every community-wide undertaking. He has been an officer of the USD since it was founded and at one time was chairman of his church board.
A man of these qualifications will be greatly- missed from the center and deserves a good opportunity wherever he goes.
Sincerely,
Nat R. Griswold Supervisor

My dear Mrs. Petty:
Miss Morrow refered your kind request for suggestions to your circle to me.
Three projects are carried on here in which your circle might be interested and willing to participate. We have what we call Toyland. It is a Games-Library from which children can take games overnight and at which they can play quiet games. Our first equipment for this was furnished by the Friends Service Committee. Of course, our games have to be constantly replaced. Furthermore, this Toyland is so popular with the young children, we would like to open two others if we could get the games. No one group can give enough for this undertaking; but if a number of church groups help, we may be able to do it.
A second enterprise is an outdoor playground. The 442nd Combat Unit, now in Italy, while it was stationed at Camp Shelby, gave us considerable equipment. But, with so many children, we constantly need new supplies of such things as: rope for swings, softballs, volleyballs, badminton sets, croquet, marbles, teeter-totters, and alike. A third activity that is popular is reading. Our present source of books is the school library fund. This does not furnish books for the smaller children in the elementary schools. So, we have a constant demand for books for small readers.
I hope this full description of some of our interest here will not give you the impression that we are
Mrs. Reece C. Petty—8/10/44—2
asking for too much. Trying to help children develop into normal youths under these circumstances of relocation center can hardly BE done were we equiped with all that heart could desire. We appreciate your interest and would be happy if any of your group come to Arkansas to have you visit us.
Sincerely yours,
Nat R. Griswold Supervisor

Dear Mr. Eaton:
We are very much interested in your letter of June 9 concerning the sending of examples of handicraft to New York to be photographed. We have had preliminary meetings with some of the evacuee artists and will have a fuller committee meeting on Monday. The few of us who have conferred reached some decision and formulated some questions.
We may have difficulty because it is so late to undertake this enterprize. School is out and the productions of the art department are scattered, I fear. Some people  with interest in the work already have relocated. Many others will go out soon, so that by September there may be very few residents here.
In spite of the above problems, the committee felt we may be able to collect a creditable representation of minor arts and crafts. However, there are certain questions related to the problems which will need to be answered. How long will the art objects be away from the center? Would you be able to return the work of individuals directly to them at a new address, in case they relocated in the meantime? In case we find some good specimen has been taken out by the owner would you care to have such sent to you direct by them?
We feel that what ever we do should be done very quickly. Most of the specimens should be sent to you by the end of this month in the hope that they could be returned by the first of August, perhaps we should employ a worker for a period of one month to collect, pack and label items. He would have to be on the W.R.A. rate of professional, $19.00. On the basis of your letter we will start such a person to work as soon as he can be found.
In our meeting Monday we will undertake to list a crafts
Mr. Allen Eaton - 2-June 16, 1945
and arts from which we will attempt to collect item. This we will send you for your suggestions. At the time also, we will undertake to select a person who can be employed for this work. Incidentally, Mabel Rose Jameson, now Mrs. Vogel, is no longer in
this center.
One matter with regard to Henry Sugimoto. In order to to have W.R.A. ship two boxes of his work from Sacramento to New York he is required to furnish a New York address. Could you permit him to have these boxes shipped to some address in your care? He thinks he will be in New York before the boxes arrive, since it will take a month at least beginning now to have them shipped. In event he is not in New York at the time of arrival he would be there in a matter of a few days. He tells me that one of the boxes is large, 5 ft. X 4 ft. X 18 in. The second box is small. You would have no obligations in case he arrives in New York before the boxes. If he doesnot arrive before the boxes, you would merely need to receive the shipment and hold them for the few days before he does arrive. I hope this is not an imposition on your good will. If it seems too difficult feel free to say so.                       
Yours sincerely,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor Community Activities

                    [transcription] => COPY July 3, 1945 AIR MAIL Mr. Paul Faris Hendrix College Conway, Arkansas Dear Mr. Faris: Referring to the photographic work which I hope you can do at the Rohwer War Relocation Branch at McGehee, I am sending you at once general information so that you may be able to follow the work up as rapidly as you find it convenient. The fact that Mr. Griswold writes me that a considerable number will be leaving the camp soon makes me hope that you can begin the work fairly soon. I shall be writing him today about the impossibilities of getting there myself soon, but I feel sure from the examples of the work which you have sent me that you will do a fine job without any further cooperation from me. The thing which we want to get is as good records as we can of certain work done in the camps which bring out the traditional ingenuity and artistry of the Japanese who have long been exceptionally interested in handicrafts and other expressions about home life. Therefore I believe we should make our first efforts cover three distinct kinds of expression, namely, handicrafts, living quarters, and gardens, and if you discover something else which you feel is characteristic please include it. I shall ask Mr. Griswold also to help us with his judgement here, and I know there are certain friends of his in camp who will be able to advise him wisely as to characteristic things to include. Handicrafts Any objects which the evacuees may have made either for their own use or gifts or possibly for sale, which have artistic merit, we should photograph. Generally speaking, I think there should 
Paul Faris -2- July 5, 1945 be but one object to a plate, and I know from your photographs that you are sensitive as to composition, light, texture, and other qualities that those objects may have. Usually I would prefer the subjects on an upright plate, that being most practical for a page reproduction, but often the composition will be such that, you can do it better justice on a horizontal plate; therefore use your judgement always about this. Whenever you can get an interesting study of a craftsman at work, including, some of his creations or working on a single object, please do so. Add in all cases will you kindly make enough notes to identify the subject and anything of special interest that you come across. Of course I am particularly interested in the use of native material and also the utilization of what might otherwise, be waste around camp. These handicraft objects would include anything made which you think of sufficient interest. Living Quarters I have seen some snapshots which illustrate well the ingenuity and taste of the Japanese in arranging some of their living quarters. I hope you will be able to include some of these. In photographing these subjects, please feel free to do them with or without characters in them. Even where there are no individuals in the pictures, they will show the character and quality of those responsible for them. However, I hope you can get some of the living quarters where members of the family are present. Gardens I hope that there are about the camp some examples of gardening, landscaping, and the management of water in pools or streams in all of which the Japanese are so artistic and ingenious. Most of these scenes should probably be without anyone in them, although I hope you may also find an opportunity to photograph some of those responsible for the gardens or otherwise connection with them. I have not undertaken here to enumerate the subjects which you might be taking, but please feel free to include anything which interests you and that you feel will come within the scope of our undertaking, I hoped that we would not have to lose time from this work through working out a plan first. I feel that you should get into it as soon as 
Mr. Paul Faris -3- July 3, 1945 possible and I hope you will rely upon me to do whatever seems fair under the circumstances. Of course you know that I cannot adequately compensate you, but I hope we can work out something that will make you happy in the work and that will bring satisfactory results to both of us. Let me thank you again for your promptness in responding to this when you learned of it from Mr. Griswold. Sincerely, Allen Eaton AE/SS

Dear Dr. Griswold:
Functioning under the theory that perseverance pays dividends, I have finally succeeded, after an uphill battle, in subduing my laziness, indolence, dilatoriness, and other bureaucratic propensities long enough to whang out an account of the recent Nisei Conference for the Washington reports office.
You will be amazed, no doubt, to learn that I was able to muster enough horsepower to complete such a stupendous, brain-taxing task.
But upon reading thru the report (if you don't chuck it out the nearest window), you will find that it has all the ear- marks of having been written between visits to the canteen, post office, and the Outpost den.
And you will be right in so assuming.
I would appreciate it if you would keep the report from the over-critical eyes of my Issei friends. They might disagree a bit with some portions of it. And I most certainly would not wish to be the cause of a sudden increase in high blood pressure cases at the local hospital.
Sincerely,
Bean Takeda

Mr. Nat R. Griswold,Supervisor, Community Activities, Rohwer Relocation Center, McGehee Arkansas.
Dear Mr. Griswold:
Within the very near future you will receive a shipment of playgroud equipment. This will not all come at one time as a good part of it has to be made to order. There are some see-saw boards being sent to you which will require a stand made of pipe. You probable will have some old pipe that you can use for this purpose. There are also some trapeze rings and bars which will require stands.
By the time you receive this letter all of our boys will have left Camp Shelby and I may say that the writer will be most lonely for some time to come.
I am leaving for Washington next week and will be away for about two weeks. As soon as I return I expect to come to Rohwer and I will be looking forward to seeing you at that time.
With kindest regards, I am,
Sincerely,
Earl M. Finch

Dear Sir:
I am sending you a lawn croquet set via Railway Express this date. Please let me know if you would like to have more of these sets as they have not been on the market for some time now  but I have made arrangements to get more if you want them.
You mentioned to me that the older men night possibly be interested in this game, I hope that they will be. I have been in New York and Washington for the past several days and have just returned to Hattiesburg. I visited a great many of our boys who are in the hospitals along the east coast while I was away. Their spirits are high and I was happy to have the opportunity of being able to visit them.
The new director of the USO here is very anxious to visit Rohwer in the near future. There is a possibility that we may come up for the week end of August 21st. I will advise you before that data should we be coming that week end.
With kindest personal regards, I am.
Very sincerely, 
Earl M. Finch

Dear Dr. Griswold:
It is my understanding that the chaplain is to return to Shelby for reassignment on this coming Tues-day. I have notified him by Estern Union, that you wish him to be there on next Sunday. I beleive that he may possibly be able to come. You should hear from him early in the week.
Should Captain Iwashita come back during the week I will make every effort to arrange for him to come there also.
I will be in Little Rock during the latter part of next week during which time I hope to see some of the boys in training at Camp Robinson.
With kindest personal regards, I am,
Very sincerely,

/s/ Earl M. Finch

Mr. Earl M. Finch Box 504
Hattiesburg, Mississippi Dear Mr. Finch:
The slides and swings were delivered to us yester-day, I have made inquiry about the priority for the pur- chase of the other items.
Our procurement officer, Mr. Moody, informs me that W.R.A. blanket priority applies only to maintenance and production. That for this purpose we would have to make application for a priority number. Since you are making the purchase he thought it advisable for you to make application direct.
I regret that you are under the necessity of going through all this red tape in order to deliver a gift to our center children. There certainly should be some way by which the matter could be handled more simply. As yet I have not found a way.
Just in case it might expedite matters I am enclosing PD 1-A form, which is a proper form on which to make appli- cation. If you find a better way in which we can make it simple for you feel free to inform us.
Sincerely yours,
Nat R. Griswold Supervisor

THE letter announcing year visit was a welcome sight to me upon my return from Denver Monday.
If it possible we would like for you to spend Saturday night with us in Rohwer. We are planning for you to meet the appointed personnel at 7:30 at evening. WE want you to tell us some of year experiences in working with Nisei and other troops - just some of the episode about which you told me.
We have discussed with our procurement office concerning materials for trapeze equipment. We may have a moment to talk with him while your here. I think he may be able to secure such materials from junk dealers since priority will not be necessary.
We would be glad to see you.
Sincerely yours,
Nat R. Griswold Supervisor

Dear Paul:
We are looking for you again Saturday. Dr. Yuasa left last night. He seemed quite pleased with your visit and especially with your work.
He had a few additional suggestions. If the cost is not prohibitive he would like for you you to try some kodachrome. He also found a lady whose rugs were more distinctive in design and thought we might photograph some of them, since Mr. Eaton seems to be very interested in rugs. He also thought we might photograph artists in calligraphy and flower arranging.
Altogether, we seemed to have enough to keep you busy next Sunday. We will be looking for you.

Sincerely,
Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor

Dear Professor Yamagiwa,
I am writing you again as a friend of Mr. Inouye and Mr. Nakamura of our center concerning their employment at the University of Michigan.
These men have not requested me to write. They both have a problem in rehabilitation about which I have occasional conferences with them. You perhaps know that making decisions in these critical times is very difficult for these matured men. The uncertainty are very great.
Since the above statements are true, it would be a great help in relieving their mental tension if some definite answer, negative or positive, could be given them. Even if the answer merely be a promise to use them in the future, this would give them something positive to tie or reassure than.
I hope you will not mistake my concern for impatience on their part.
Yours sincerely,
Nat R. Griswold Supervisor Community Activities

Dear Colonel Watts:
We have been very happy to have occasional visits from the men under your command. Their coming always stimulates new concern in our community for the members of the armed forces. The conduct of your men has always been commendable.
Sometimes we have been unable to prepare for their coming adequately. Were it possible to fix more of less regular schedule for these visits it would make simpler and more adequate our preparations here. Fur- thermore, it would permit a larger number of our resi- dents to get acquainted with the boys and to extend courtesies.
Therefore, we would like to suggest that the boys plan to come regularly every two weeks. In case of emergencies, which are bound to occur, your special officer could wire us cancellations. The difference in this and the present procedure is that at present we are notified of the intention of the boys to come and in this arrangement we would be notified only in case of cancellation
This may be entirely impossible. If so, we are happy to go ahead as formerly. In any event we are glad to have the boys come.
Sincerely,
Ray D. Johnston Project Director

Bear Billy:
Your good letter is a fine illustration of
how the Kingdom may come. We are altogether aware of the problems of educating the masses of people with reference to human understanding.
The response from the churches throughout the country and from Methodist Churches has been highly gratifying. Already we have had more than 3,000 gifts for children and young people sent from individuals and religous organizations. Our cash donations have been generous on the whole and it now appears that we will have enough cash to care for expenses with the help of donations from the local Red Cross.
You may be sure that we appreciate your friendship to us in the center. We will be thinking of you and yours during this Christmas season. The parties for the children will be held on Christmas Eve itinerating Santa Clauses will make the rounds of the blocks. You may imagine what it will men to us all.
Cordially yours,

Dear 'Fessor:
I am embarrassed both by my slowness in answering your letter of November 21, and by the answer I am forced to make to it. I have been holding back, looking for a ggod opening, but it hasn't come. The WSCS here has under advisement sending toys to one of the Relocation Branches. It has cuased some unfavorable co vent from some of the sisters - naturally. I think it will go through at a meeting today, however. I had planned to ask that a liberal Communion offering be left for your group, the first Sunday of this month, but I did not think it quite advisable under the circumstances. I move rather slowly in such matters— assurer that no church is helped by the pastor "busting" into something that causes disharmony.. If I had been here long enough to have built confidence in my leadership, it would be different. I hope you do get enough funds to take care of your expenses. In case you do not, lease write me again after Christmas, and I'll see to it that some comes in from some source here.
Best wishes to you and Mrs. Griswold during this Christmas season.
Very sincerely yours,
/s/ Billy Cooley

								April 29, 1943

Miss Mabel Rose Jamison
42-1-D
Japanese Relocation Center
Rohwer, Arkansas

Dear Miss Jamison:

	I am still remembering what a delightful visit you helped us to have at the Japanese Relocation Center and what a stimulating visit we managed to squeeze in.  I do wish we could have had more time for that.

	Under separate cover I am sending you some copies of The Window of U.W.A. and World Comrades as I promised, with the thought that you might encourage your students to do something for covers and for decorative insets.  I am sending you some manuals of our organizations to remind you of their proper and distinctive symbolisms as someone begins to think in terms of headings for the Sunbeam Band programs, for the Royal Ambassador programs or for the Girls’ Auxiliary programs.  We sometimes have such headings go across the top of the page, then we had some that were up and down on the page.  I do not know that there is any particular law about which way is better except that now that we have created a shortage of paper we cannot have as many bleed-off pages; that is, there has to be a little margin left instead of letting the design go off the side of the page.

	Since leaving you I have had another thought.  We always have for our Young Woman’s Auxiliary Camp at Ridgecrest, North Carolina, some central motif which decorates the bare stone wall at which we would otherwise have to look.  Last year we had the lovely window (which you will notice on the cover of one of the copies of The Window of Y.W.A.  I am sending to you).  We used this because we had more or less an historical idea in mind and were recalling biographies.  This year our theme for Y.W.A. Camp is to be, “Building on Undergirding Loyalties.”  I had in mind a lovely mural which would depict the things of modern life in war, industry, agriculture, and all such, as they appear to all people, showing the different races, with the things on which we must build like the Cross, Christian churches and the open Bible.  I do not know enough about murals to know whether all these basic fundamental foundation things should actually be like the ground floor with the present circumstances on top of them or not—you would know about that.  It has occurred to me that maybe your talented students would like to work on that.  After you got it planned together, different ones could do different sections.

	The mural should be about twelve feet long, and I suppose about three widths of that brown wrapping paper of which you would be likely to make it.

	There is a light in the very top of the platform space which would be a sort of flood light for such a mural.

	Not knowing about murals from an artistic standpoint, I do not know whether the three sections should be separate, with space in between which might even be used for appropriate scripture verses which would be put in between the sections of the mural, or should one picture go from top to bottom, pasting the three sections together?  I can prove to my own satisfaction a very lovely mural in either case.

	This may not be anything that you would be interested in having your students work on at all, but on the other hand, it might be of interest, and I shall be more than grateful if it is.  Perhaps you would want to send me some small rough sketches before you get into the work of the whole business, if the idea strikes you with any pleasure.  It would of course want to be in lovely colors which will be inspiring to look at as a background to all the services in the large auditorium, then probably at the close of the night sessions we would put out the lights and have on the light concentrated on the mural with special music or special poem or prose reading for a few moments of closing worship and meditation.  Really this center motif or worship center is one of the most important parts of our Y.W.A. Camp life and one of the things the girls remember best.  It would be even more meaningful if your students wanted to do this for us and could take the time for it.

	The Y.W.A. Camp starts June 17, so to allow plenty of time for it to be shipped across, it would need to be finished, I should think, by the last of May.

	At first I thought I was not going to be able to find a single 116 film in this city, but we found one place where we could buy two, so I am sending these under separate cover.  I am a little bit puzzled by all the x’s on the box, but I hope they simply mean it is a perfectly good film.

Miss Mabel Rose Jameson

Relocation Center
McGehee, Arkansas

Dear Miss Jameson:

	We were ever so glad to have your letter and have been hoping every day that some sketch would come in.  I can just see how much it would mean to camp to have some lovely, colorful mural made by the people I the Relocation Center.

	Indeed we can get the unbleached muslin and send it to you for this and will do so the minute we know you are going to need it.  So, as soon as we hear from you we shall dash out and acquire some and send it forthwith.

	I am glad the films were all right and hope that sometime you will have a chance to do some writing and send us some stories with pictures—that will be grand.

	I hope life moves on well there.  Have you had opportunity to meet our Bette Ishibashi now that she is there after graduating from our Training School?  I wonder how the plans are coming along for that artistic girl to go and help with the handcraft in the Arkansas camps.  I have told several people about her lovely Bambi and Himmel reproductions and they could hardly believe it.  I wish there were some way she could send them out and we could sell them for her.  I believe the girls at Ridgecrest would just take to them like everything.

	I hope you are keeping well in all the enthusiastic stir of life there and hope the mural is growing splendidly.

Miss Mabel Rose Jameson
42-1-D
Relocation Center
McGehee, Arkansas

Dear Miss Jameson:

	Did the mural get back to you in time for your exhibit?  We took it down the minute camp was over and rushed it off special delivery as fast as we could.  (This, of course, was dictated before Miss Mather received your letter telling her the mural had reached you.)  We have no words to express how delighted we were with the mural.  I wish you could have seen it.  The photographer came and took pictures of it as it hung in front of the big auditorium and I have sent three copies of the picture to you—one for you and one for each of the artists.  It certainly was wonderfully well done and everyone was so pleased.  We could hardly wait as we went along on the train to Ridgecrest to see if it really was there and how it looked, and when we opened it, I wish you could have seen our delight and gratification.  It was nicer than I could imagine it could have been.  I saw the girls look at it from time to time, and I believe it was very helpful in challenging their thinking.  I know that every time I looked at it I saw something new that I had not seen before.

	I wanted to write you from up at Ridgecrest, but I wonder if you can imagine how crowded the days are when one is directing a camp of 806 young women.  Letters just are not written.  Twice I worded telegrams to get off to you and then got no farther than the thought.  I told Bette Ishibashi to be sure to look around and find you and the two young men and express to them in person our appreciation.

	I am enclosing a check for you to divide as a thank you to Mr. Ichiba and Mr. Toyofuku.  I plan to use a cut of the picture on the September cover of The Window of Y. W. A.   We hope to have an article in this magazine about Japanese relocation centers.  It occurs to me that it would add interest to the picture if Mr. Ichiba and Mr. Toyofuku would have a little something to say about their thoughts as they planned and worked on the mural.  Do you suppose they would like to write a hundred or one hundred fifty words about that.  Then, I would be delighted also to have some autobiographical or biographical sketch of each of the artists; also what about a picture of each of the artists to accompany the articles?  Do you suppose they would be good enough to do that for us right away soon?

	I wonder how things are going there at the center and what the plans for another school year are.

	I shall always be grateful for the fine way in which you managed to have this lovely mural made for us.   You would have been so proud if you could have seen in (sic) on the front wall and we are so grateful to you.

	Don’t forget the other things you thought you might be able to do for the magazines as time goes by.

	I am interested to know how the little girl who did all the carving will get along with the handcraft over at Ferncliff.  I am still remembering those clever Bambis and those lovely Himmel copies.

	You have certainly had some interesting experiences with these Japanese-Americans and I am so glad that you and Reba Hayes have been there to help them to the Christian approach that Caucasians want to make toward their problems.

	Thank you again and again for the mural.

							Sincerely yours,

Dear Miss Jameson:

Thank you so much for your letter which prompted me to send the telegram and for your telegraphed reply.  The printer is on his ear because I held up the galley proofs to add the bits of autobiography and thoughts from the two young men but I wanted them in when the mural was used on the cover.  I could not wait to have cuts made from these individual pictures and I am sorry about that but I am using the picture showing them at work on the mural.  I would loved to have used these individual pictures but the way it worked out I could not manage it.

I was delighted with the autobiographic sketches and the thoughts that the boys had.  I believe they will help the girls to see all they put into the mural.

I still do not have adequate words to express my appreciation to you and them.  I wish they might have heard all the approving comments made during the camp days.  I am sure it really did a great deal of good in the enlarged thinking of the girls and the adults who were there.  I know you must feel very gratified by what the boys wrote.  It is fine that they felt as they did about it, and I am glad for you to have this joy of seeing how your work and your life have counted there.

I hope the boys will be pleased with the appearance of the mural on the cover of the magazine.  I think it has reproduced very nicely though of course it is not by any manner of means as warm in color as the original was.  I had the photographer take the picture at Ridgecrest and then there was a girl from Memphis who had registered herself as a commercial artist and I asked her to color one of the dull finish pictures like the mural.   That is the one I had to use in the reproduction.  That is the reason I sent the boys the dull finish instead of the glossy print.  I thought they might want to put all the colors on and preserve it for their grandchildren.

I think the engraver has done a fairly good job in making the cuts, now if the printer will just do a good bit of work on getting the cover nicely reproduced the necessary thousands of times, all will be well.

I wonder what you are going to do with the mural now that the exhibit is over.  I am not sure that I would have any special use for it, but I don’t want it just down in a corner forgotten.  I would be glad to keep it for display next year even if we had something else for the central decoration on the platform.  I could use it in another room there so the girls who came next year could see it also.  Then I think I could show it to our executive committee meeting in January.  That would be two nice uses for it.  It might be that some State use could be made of it here or there.  I do not know whether you have anything more extensive or valuable than these uses or not.  Anyway, I will be glad to welcome it back if you have nothing in mind.  I shall never cease to be grateful for it.

I hope you will have a good rest and I shall look forward to some stories or sketches from you although that does not come with a wish for rest does it?

							Cordially yours,

Dear Mabel Rose:

	I have just come back from Birmingham where Miss Mather had displayed the mural in the room where we had one of the luncheons.   Since I am using the theme “Building A New World” for the Intermediate G.A. Conference at Central College, March 3-5, I am wondering about using it as the background on the platform there.  Would you lend it to me?  Do you have any idea what the express or freight charges on it are?  It would seem that they would not be so much but what we could afford them for this meeting.  I am enclosing a self-addressed envelope for you to use in giving me your answer.  Time is not very far off for this conference and so I would like to have your answer soon, please.

	I have enjoyed using some things you had sent to Miss Sherwood while I was in Birmingham for I was privileged to tell about the centers before the Young People’s Secretaries at their conference.  I had some things that I had gotten, too, and so the secretaries became quite interested in the work.

	I have just heard that Bette has married and I am so glad for her.  Certainly I hope that she is returning to the Center for the duration to continue her splendid mission work.  I have asked her to conference and I am counting on her being there.

						Lovingly yours,

Miss Mabel Rose Jamison
Relocation Center
McGehee, Arkansas

Dear Mabel Rose:

	How do I thank you for the mural.  It was just the setting that we needed for our program for Conference for all the talks Miss Mather gave was depicted in some way on that mural.  I am enclosing postage to cover your having sent it to us.  It served not only Conference but a missionary society for its Home Mission program Monday, and also the Y.W.A. Associational meeting at which Miss Mather spoke last night.  We will be shipping it back to you perhaps tomorrow.  I truly am thankful for it and for your kindness in sending it and lending it to us.

	I am wondering about camp this summer and handwork again.  Ruth was such a joy to us and it was so good having her to mix and mingle with our girls.  Although I am majoring on Indian mission work this summer, the things we will make will be such as some girl from there could very easily teach us to make.  Would you have a girl again for this year?  I would want her for two camps instead of the one since this year I am having a junior G.A. camp for July 17-22 and an intermediate camp from July 24-29.  The same girl could serve and stay right on through, having the week end to rest in out there at camp for I will be staying over, too.

	I wonder if you would have a boy who could lead handwork at our R.A. camp.  This camp comes July 30-August 5.  I have some things in mind for the handwork along the Indian line but will appreciate any suggestions that you may have.  One or two ideas for the girls’ camp is the making of little shoes out of chamois and beading them.  Another is making little Seminole Indian dolls and dressing them.  We could even do bead work like making bracelets and rings if you have a girl who knows that art.  Do boys like to do bead work?  What could be a project or two for boys

Dear Miss Jamison:

Miss Mather tells us that it is possible for us to “borrow” the lovely mural that your boys painted!  I am wondering if we could use it in Mississippi from July 3-15?  If so, we would like to have it shipped to the address given below.  I will appreciate it if you will let me know on the enclosed card if we can count on it.

Sincerely yours,

Mayor  Rosalie S. Gould
CITY OF MCGHEE
P.O. Drawer 612
McGhee, Arkansas 71654

Madam Mayor;

Yesterday, May 2, 1991, was a wonderful day and to cap off a wonderful day, I found a letter in our mail box from a very dear friend, Gray, who along with his letter mailed me clippings from the Memphis Commercial Appeal.  I read Gray’s letter and newspaper clippings and I was overwhelmed by emotions and found myself wiping tears from my eyes.

First off, the article by Jerry Houston was excellent; however, I need to point out one little error.  Mr. Houston states that the action was based entirely upon the nationality of the internees and that is not the case.  A good segment of the people were Japanese by nationality but a greater number were Americans by birth.  I should point out the fact that the laws back then prevented Asian immigrants from becoming citizens of the United States.

Society back then was not anything like what it is today.  In the last half of this century, the throes of social changes in this country has enabled society to evolve into the enlightened state that it is in today.  Back then, the Japanese immigrants were not allowed to own land and the American Dream was something unattainable.

The catalyst that launched the Japanese-American on the path of social metamorphosis was the cowardly attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941.  Little did our parents suspect that the changes that were to come about would have such a profound effect on their destiny.

My experiences as a child had a very negative impact on my outlook on life for the longest time and from the time of our release from the camp and well into my adult life I did not feel that I fit in with the main-stream of society and the negatives just festered deep inside me.  As an adult, I turned to alcohol as an escape from my own feelings and I made myself a very miserable person for the longest time until John Barleycorn did me in.

I sought help and with the help of many loving and caring people, I was guided in the direction of recovery.  The recovery process necessitated a thorough and honest look at myself and my experiences and, in the process, I was able to look at things objectively for the first time.  I learned to look for the good in everything and it was necessary for me to address the big bugaboo of my life’s experience.  I found it necessary to contemplate the war years and much to my surprise I discovered many fond memories of events and people who touched my life in such a manner that I should be grateful.  The people that touched my life were loving and caring individuals who practiced the principles of Christian love unlike those who merely pay lip service to Christian teachings.

I was born in Rosemead, California in the middle of the depression years and my father was a Japanese national and my mother was an American of Japanese ancestry.  Rosemead is a suburb of Los Angeles and is located roughly twelve miles east of the city.  My parents were both school teachers and they taught at the San Gabriel Valley Japanese School.  We lived in an area that was predominately white with Japanese-American interspersed through-out the valley.  We lived in a nice two bedroom bungalow and life was very pleasant and our neighbors were all very nice.

The attack on Pearl Harbor brought about some drastic changes in our lives and the changes came about very rapidly.  Monday night the 8th of December was the first traumatic experience to occur when the F.B.E. together with the Los Angeles County Sheriffs raided our home and literally tore the house apart on the pretext of searching for contrabands.   A contraband could consist of an every day (sic) radio receiver, a flash light, any literature in the Japanese language, cameras or firearms.  The flash light, radio, books and a .22 caliber rifle were taken from our home.

The second time the F.B.I. paid us a visit was about 10:30 P.M. on the 13th of February, 1942 at which time my dad was handcuffed and taken away.  People who were educated and considered community leaders were arrested and these people were business people, Buddhist priests, Protestant ministers, school teachers, etc.

Ninety days subsequent to my father’s arrest, notices were posted in our neighborhood instructing us to report to an assembly point with only baggage we can carry.  My mother and I were transported to a temporary camp site at the Santa Anita Race Track in Arcadia, California.  Many people were put in the stables which still reeked of horse manure and we were housed in the hastily constructed barracks in the parking area of the racetrack.  Conditions there were bleak and quite harsh.  The barracks, because of the haste in which they were built, were crude and there was no heat and the cracks in the floor allowed dust and cold air in at nights.  The days were extremely hot due to the fact that the barracks were located on the paved parking lot and there was no shade anywhere.  A communal shower located about a quarter of a mile from our quarters served the entire camp population and there was six messhalls (sic) where we partook of our meals which were adequate.

The camp were (sic) my father was in New Mexico was governed by the Geneva Convention because the camp housed P.O.W.’s; however, our camps were not and when dad was repatriated to our camp in mid 1944, he complained about the food.

Once the permanent camps were completed, the camp residents were shipped out to camps in Arizona, Colorado, Arkansas and other points.  As it turned out we were shipped to Rohwer.  As a child, I was thrilled by the fact that I was in for a train ride; however, the trains were packed like cattle cars and the second day on the train dashed all my hopes for a thrilling ride when I became ill and I could not keep any food down.  I recall that on the fourth day I saw some ocean going vessels moored in a river and we arrived in Rohwer the following day.

With a childish curiosity, I peered out from the train window and what I saw was a neatly laid out camp and this camp was surrounded by barbed wire and there were guard towers at intervals along the perimeter with search lights.  There were a group of men who apparently arrived before us helping people off the trains and we were loaded on to the back of a one ton stake bed truck and transported to the block which was to become my home for the duration.

We were assigned to block 32, Barrack 3, Unit C.  The entire camp of Rohwer consisted of 48 blocks with twelve barracks which had 6 units each.  In the center of the block between two rows of six barracks were the mess and the communal bath and wash facilities.

In the camp, there were two large common areas where the baseball diamond and community facilities were located and in the west common area was a large community building and it served as a meeting place as well as a motion picture house.  I recall seeing the motion picture the “King of Kings” in that hall.

The barracks in Rohwer were much better in construction than those we left in Santa Anita.  Each unit had one wood burning stove in the middle of the unit and this provided heat in the winter.  Compared to the homes we left in California, the conditions were bleak; however, people quickly acclimatized themselves to the new environment.  It seems that the best and the worst in human nature surfaces under trying conditions.  People who were respected in the outside community demonstrated greed by sneaking more than their allocation of firewood and in the messhalls (sic), they would try to sneak extra portions of food.  On the other hand, those who maintained low profile I the outside community turned out to be giving people who were always available to help their fellow internees in the time of need.

As people got settled into the routine of camp life, many people started to show innovative traits.  In the camp people started to supplement their diets by growing vegetables and in many of the blocks, this became a community effort and rootcellars (sic) were constructed to store the harvest for the winter months.  Others ventured into the woods after a rain and harvested a mushroom like growth that grew at the roots of the trees.

An elderly gentleman who lived in 32-4-C right across from our unit built rabbit traps from discarded scrap of lumber and he would come back from the woods with gunny sacks full of live rabbits and he would put them in a make-shift cage under the barracks.  He would slaughter one or two at a time and we would cook them over an open fire and he would share with others.  Still others would go off into the woods to a canal and come back with huge cat fish and again they would share with the rest of the people in the block.  For the adults in camp, boredom was the worst enemy; however, everybody soon developed hobbies such as wood working, weaving, drawing and poetry.  I still have some of the things and I also have some water colors that my dad did of camp.

All of the heavy work like getting the firewood was a community effort and all the men of the block participated.  On occasions like New Years, all the ladies got together to prepare a special meal with the rations we had available.  After a period of time, the competitive spirit within the camp motivated each block to make their block the most esthetically pleasing bock in the camp.  This effort was evidenced by the flowers that were planted and the landscape scheme of each block.  Block 32 took  pride in the fact that most of us were city slickers and we really went hog landscaping the common areas with our block.

The two camp schools were located on Block 31 and Block 36.  Some of the instructors were of Japanese ancestry and others were Caucasians who were hired to teach in the camp.  My first grade teacher was Mrs. Thelma Keith from Fayetteville, Arkansas and she became a life long (sic) friend until she passed away a few years back.  I had the honor of attending her funeral.  Mrs. Keith was aware of the fact that I was the only child in her class whose father was in a separate camp and she took me under her wings and was very instrumental in getting my education going in the proper direction.  In 1943 Mrs. Keith gave up her post to go to work in a defense industry; however, she kept the post cards and letters coming to me and she kept in touch.  As a matter of fact, towards the end of the Korean War, I enlisted in the Army and when Mrs. Keith found out that I was to take my advanced basic training at Camp Chaffee, she asked me to visit her mother in Fayetteville.  I did take her up on her offer and I visited Mrs. Clark for a weekend.  Mrs. Clark and all her neighbors got together and showed me what good Southern hospitality was all about.

It was in school that I met my best friend Gray Matlock. It was miraculous how friendship transcended cultural differences and I can only attribute this to the good Christian upbringing Mr. and Mrs. Matlock gave to their children.  We spent much time together doing things little boys do and often times while they still lived at the camp facilities, they invited me to share in meals with their family.  My best childhood memory is that weekend which they took me to their family home in Dumas and treated me to a weekend I will never forget. It I recall correctly, it was Thanksgiving and during this time I was given a treat of going to a movie and after the movie I was treated to an ice cream soda at the local drugstore fountain.  The Thanksgiving dinner was delightful and after I devoured a good portion of turkey, they invited me to try some meat from the other platter.  The meat looked delicious and I did try and after I had my fill they explained to me that it was “coon meat” and I really have not had an opportunity to try it again.  The following Sunday, we attended  church service in Dumas and the people were all so warm and friendly.

I too remember the young soldiers from Camp Shelby visiting our camp on the weekends.  To accommodate the soldiers’ social needs a camp U.S.O. was formed and I recall the dances where they jitter bugging to music from a phonograph.  In return, the soldiers would entertain us with Hawaiian music since a large number of them were fro Hawaii.  I also recall the sad moments when the first casualty reports started to trickle into the camp.  Memorial services were held for the soldiers from Rohwer.  The services were unusual since it was a multi-faith services (sic) officiated over by Protestant, Catholic and Buddhist clergy.  As a child, I was excited to see the Nisei soldiers as honor guards firing the volley (sic) of shots in a final salute to their fallen comrades.

The Maryknoll priest who saw to the needs of the Catholics in Rohwer was Father Edward Ryan.  He was a red faced Irish man who had a pleasant touch of the Irish brogue when he spoke; however, even more amazing is the fact that this man spoke Japanese without an accent.  Christmas Eve of 1944, he brought a portable organ to our messhall (sic) and as a morale booster, he played the organ and in his magnificent Irish tenor voice, led the people in our block in singing Christmas carols.  Later that evening, he started to sing Japanese folk songs by himself to entertain the elders and I remember the tears that were running down the cheeks of the elders that were present.

We were not allowed to bring pets into the camp; however, there was a teenaged lad I Block 9 who found a chicken hawk that fell out of a nest and he raised the bird and it became a pet.  The bird would follow him everywhere.  The lad was a student at the block 36 school and the bird would wait for him to get out of school and follow him home every day.

Until my dad was repatriated to Rohwer from Lordsburg, New Mexico, life was rough for me being the only child on the block who’s (sic) father was in a separated camp.  I recall the winter of ’42 when there was a significant snow fall in Rohwer, the fathers of the other children made them sleds from scrap lumber and I envied them.  I wanted one so bad; however, my mother did not have the skills that would enable her to make me one.  Once my dad was reunited with us, he made me toys and he made a kite that I was very proud of.

All during this time Gray Matlock and I were constant companions and there was another lad Gray mentions.  The curly haired red head was Billy Johnson whose father was the camp administrator Ray Johnson.  I understood that they were from Little Rock.  We did what little kids do and sometime we would play in the red mud and understandably, our mothers would not be too happy with us when we came back all muddy.  The kids in our block collected pollywogs and crawfish from the ditches surrounding each block and kept ourselves entertained.

There were a lot of things that I could not understand at the time the event took place; however, today I can fully understand what happened.  During World War II it was difficult to have prisoner exchange between the Japanese government because the fanatical Japanese forces brainwashed their people to think that surrender was dishonorable and that death was honorable.  Because of this condition, there were very few Japanese P.O.W.s we could exchange for Americans.  The government got the idea to exchange internees for prisoners and with this they actively pushed to have internees sign up to go to Japan as exchange prisoners.  For many of the elders who were citizens of Japan the outlook was grim and they chose to be returned to their homeland which they have not seen for years.  Mind you, the children of these people were all Americans by birth; however, since they have not reached their majority, they were shipped off to an enemy country with their parents.

I remember one of the shipments.  The people were all herded in to Block 31, the school block, and there were guards all round the block some with shot guns, some with rifle and others with Thompsons and in that group was a boy name (sic) Ken who was a playmate.  He was crying and I could not understand what was happening at the time.  These people were transported to Newport News where they were loaded on to a neutral ship the “Gripsholm” and sailed to a neutral port where they were exchanged for American P.O.Ws and loaded on to a Japanese vessel for the trip to Japan.

The young lad I mentioned in the previous paragraph and countless others who were Americans too young to make decisions were killed in bombing raids and never did return to their land of birth.  Ultimately most of the ones that survived the fire bomb raids of Tokyo and others from Hiroshima who survived the A-bomb raid returned to the U.S. and the stories they had to share were horrendous.  Because they were Americans, they were treated like dirt in Japan and were treated like second class citizens.

Some time about ’43 or ’44 the camp in Jerome was converted to a German P.O.W. camp and the internees there were shipped to Rohwer and to other locations.  Things got a little snug after the people from Jerome arrived.  About this time the course of the war was going favorably for the Allies in every theater of operations.  With this change, the government was letting the young adults who were citizens out to work in defense industries through out (sic) the Midwest and the east coast.  With this, we witnessed an exodus of the young adults from the camp and many settled in places like Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, New York and other places.  Many did not return to California after the war.

Another day that is etched into my memory vividly is the day my dad arrived in Rohwer from Lordsburg, New Mexico.  I was very excited to have dad back with us.  In excited anticipation my mother and I with a few of the people who lived on our block went to the main gate to welcome him.  An olive drab bus pulled up at the gate on schedule and people disembarked as I strained my eyes to see if I could spot dad.  My dad was an unusual man for a Japanese.  He had loose wavy hair and had large eyes for an Asian and the memory of my dad was a man who was slight in structure but with well developed muscles and a head full of wavy hair.  As the people approached, I spotted a man in a dark green overcoat, dark green trousers and a dark green cap and this man turned back, momentarily, to wave to the people on the bus headed for another destination and I spotted the big white stenciled letter P.W. on his back and as he approached I noticed over his left breast numbers in white stenciled and as he got even closer he removed his cap and he was bald.  The camp in Lordsburg just took everything out of my dad and he was just a shell of that man he used to be.  Nevertheless, he grasped my hand and I knew without a doubt, that this was my father.  I will never forget that day.

Upon return to the family, dad became very active in community activities and he become (sic) a member of the Community Affairs board for the camp and he spent much time writing poetry, making things out of wood.  Dad taught language classes at the night school at the Block 31 school and he taught both Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.

The day finally came when we were permitted to return to California and I was very excited about the whole thing.  The day we left, I wore a pair of trousers my mother made and I wore a grey sweater that my mother knitted for me.  We were loaded on to a truck right outside the Block 32 messhall (sic).  The people gathered to see us off and I remember a playmate Toshi whose family was from Madera, California was there and he was looking up to me and waving.  He always had a runny nose and that day was no different and his nose was running as always.  I often wondered whatever happened to him.  I’ve driven through Madera several times and each time I stop at a phone booth to check the directory to see if he is listed; however, to no avail.  There were many friendships developed during those years and I often wonder and think about many people.  It is by the Grace of God that I was able to locate the Matlocks and I should remind myself to be in touch with gratitude at all times.

After the truck left Rohwer, it travelled down that red gravel road towards McGehee and the anticipation kept building up inside me.  When we arrived at the McGehee Station, my dad bought me an ice cream cone and it was so delicious that, at the time, it was like ambrosia to me.  The train took us to St. Louis where we were put aboard a troop train headed for the Pacific Coast.  The soldiers aboard the train were like most soldiers and were generous to a kid and they were getting me candy, gum and boxes of raisins.  I was not accustomed to having sweets for such a long time, that I got sick on the raisins.  Would you believe I could not bring myself about to eat raisins until about 1972?

Upon our return to the west coast, we found things were quite difficult since we returned to a very hostile environment.  Employment was virtually impossible to obtain for my parents and my father who had a Masters from Columbia was relegated to do menial work for quite some time.  The people were conditioned to identify us as the “enemy” because it was easier to spot us as opposed to German-American or Italian-Americans.  However, after a few years things slowly returned to normal.

Psychologically, I felt inferior and I did not feel like I fitted in.  When I returned to  the public schools here, I felt guilty because I felt the reason for my incarceration was the fact that we were guilty people.  A lot of fears, anger and inadequacies festered for a long time. As a young adult, I found that alcohol anesthetized me and I found that I could manage; however, the time came when it stopped working for me and I sought recovery.

As mentioned at the beginning, my recovery has introduced me to a life which has put me back in touch with a loving God and I have been able to address life on life’s term.  This opened up a vast horizon of new awareness.  Thus, I was able to locate some people who have touched my life and I was able to make my amends to these fine people for having ignored their love and kindness all these years.

Subsequent to the war, I grew up in a predominately caucasian environment and my classmates were all caucasian and I had very little contact with the Japanese-American community.  I have turned into what the Asian-Americans refer to as a “Banana”…white on the inside and yellow on the outside.  I am married presently to a French Canadian and my kids are a Heinz 57 and I have a blonde blue eyed grand-daughter and my life today is a very rewarding experience.

Several years ago I had the chance to drive east to visit my in-laws in Quebec, Canada.  On this trip I visited the camp sites in Lordsburg and in Rohwer.  I don’t know if you had the opportunity to see the motion picture “Twelve O’Clock High” with Gregory Peck; however, when I arrived at Rohwer, I had a similar experience as that gentleman in the movie when he rode his bike to the abandoned air field in England overgrown with weeds and the only sound was that of the wind and the birds and his memories travelled back in time and the story commenced.  Such was my experience when I arrive at Rohwer that Sunday morning.

From the cemetery I looked north and spotted the smokestack which used to be the hospital boiler stack and I was able to orient myself.  Memories returned and I started to think about all the people that I knew at one time.  Later I drove back on the main road (now paved) and drove in the direction I remembered the main gate to be.  Sure enough, I found the location and I turned on the road way and drove by a few residences and beyond I found a few of the original buildings.  The rest of the road ways were quite overgrown but I managed to get back to the location where I found the old water tank.  From there it was quite easy to find the exact location where our block was.  I took many photos and I have made up an album of memories.

After we left Rohwer, we drove towards McArthur and on to Dumas in the wild hope that I would be able to locate the Matlocks.  Needless to say, I was not successful but we did enjoy a fine cat fish dinner in Dumas.

The sands of time keeps (sic) moving but it will never irradicate (sic) the memories of the war years.  The picture I have in my mind’s eye of Gray is that of a young lad I knew then.  I hope that some day (sic) we will be able to see each other and I am confident that I will be able to do so.

I have several things which I would be glad to donate to your museum.  The young people of today are out of touch with these things and I know my children will not treasure these items.  I would much prefer to turn them over to you.  Specifically, I have a few water colors by my dad, a “Year Book” put out by the Rohwer Red Cross, items that represent some of the wood work and miscellaneous documents.  If you are interested, I will gladly pack these things and forward them to you.

Writing is very difficult for me and there is so much to tell; however, time and my limited writing talent restricts me from doing a complete job.  Perhaps, some day (sic) I will meet you and I will be able to share it with you.  For the past few years, as a part of my on going  (sic) recovery, I have spoken to many groups throughout California, England, Canada and Hawaii and the camp experience is an integral part of my story and I have shared about the Matlocks and as well as Mrs. Keith.

I hope this will give you some insight about my experiences.

Sincerely,



Edward Y. Inouye

	Dear Mrs. Inouye:

		We have just received a message from Lordsburg, New Mexico,
	stating that Mr. Michimase Inouye will be released from the Lordsburg 
	Camp on May 21 and furnished transportation by rail to McGehee, 
	Arkansas.

		He is scheduled to arrive at 4:35 a.m. and will be met at the 
	Train.  We would like to advise you to prepare for some delay since train
schedules have been rather irregular recently, but Mr. Inouye is likely to
arrive sometime during the day of May 23, if on time.

							Sincerely yours,

Honorable Edward J. Ennis
Alien Enemy Control Unit
Department of Justice
Washington, D. C.

Sir:				Re:  Parolee case of Michimasa Inouye

	I was released from Lordsburg Internment Camp, New Mexico on May 21,
1943 and am now on parole, residing at the Rohwer Relocation Center.

	I respectfully request your honor for reconsideration for a release from the 
parolee status.

	I have been living in peace and comfort in the United States for the past 
twenty three years, for which I feel a debt of gratitude to this country.  I have no
property or money at all in Japan.  My life interest is here, I have a wife who is
American born and a child who was also born in the United States.

	Although I have adhered to the American ideals and cooperated with my
fellow American, it is likely that I was interned because I conducted a Japanese
Language School as a means of living.  There was no specific charge made
against me.

	Today many young boys whom I had taught the Japanese language are in
the U. S. Army  and are dedicating their lives for this country, using that language.

	At my hearing in Lordsburg Internment Camp, the point was made that we 
should be given more freedom so we could contribute to the war effort and I swore
that I would participate in the war effort if I were given a chance.  This seems more
important as the man-power shortage increases.

	My family is eagerly anticipating the day when we can relocate for normal
Living, particularly to get my boy in school outside.  First, however, there is awaiting
the fetter of “parolee” to be removed.  This carries a feeling of disgrace and prevents 
freedom of movement and easy procurement of work.  So, it is very important to
have my status officially changed from parolee to release.

	I sincerely hope you will understand my feeling under these circumstances
and kindly grant me free status.  I am confident that your sense of justice and fair
play will give me very good consideration.

							Respectfully submitter,

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

Los Angeles 15, California

							February 10, 1945

	Mr. Michimasa Inouye
	32-3-C
	Rohwer Relocation Center
	McGehee, Arkansas

	Dear Mr. Inouye:

		Your letter addressed to Mrs. Bruff has been referred to me.

		We are glad you are planning to leave the center as soon as
	possible.  There is no need for you to be fearful about your children in 
	school.  School authorities everywhere and the children in school 
	have been very fine.  We hear a great many very fine reports from
	Japanese whose children have been going to school and to churches.

		The sentiments of the majority in this section of California are
	distinctly good.  All constituted authorities, officials and law enforce-
	ment agencies have given unqualified assurances of co-operation.  
	Of course, it would be impossible to guarantee against isolated 
	instances of prejudice.  However, it is fair to say that there is no danger 
	of responsible organized opposition.

		Housing is particularly difficult unless you have your own home
	yet.

		Jobs are plentiful, but the variety of jobs is still not much, but will
	grow.

		My suggestion would be that if you are awfully uncertain, that
	you come to Los Angeles on a short term and see for yourself what the
	situation looks like.  The American Friends Service Committee has a 
	hostel at 506 North Evergreen.  You could communicate with them to 
	make a reservation for yourself there.

		I understand Mr. Bruff is writing you directly.

							Sincerely yours


							G. RAYMOND BOOTH
							District Relocation Officer

Dear Mabel Rose,

		I do thank you for your money order which I received last week! The fans came to me in good shape.  I should write you soon but I have been so busy because my relatives from California have been visiting here.
	A letter from Mos Kinoshita came from Colo. Gen. Hospital.  I was so surprised that he had come back in the United State (sic) already.  He wrote that his illness is not so serious that you don’t need worry about it.  And he will be moved to some eastern Hospital a few months later.
	His present address is, --
		Cpl M. Kinoshita
		Ward C-1 Fitzsimons Gen. Hospital
		Denver, Colo.
	Oh, yes, I went to see Mr. White, White Lany Co. in N.J. whom Mr. Thomases introduced me.  The work was not satisfactory to me so I could not take it.
					
							Sincerely yours

								Henry

P.S.  Sumile is overjoyed at taking the new bag around.  She is simply thrilled
	There is a little friend of Sumile’s who would like to have similar bag and zipper ring folder.  Would you ask Herbert whether another set could be bought at the same price?  Let me know when you write me next.
	Hellow (sic) to Herbert!

AIR MAIL
Mr. Ray Johnston Project Director Rohwer Relocation Center Relocation, Arkansas
Dear Mr. Johnston:
I have discussed with several people here, including Mr. Utz, the problem of a swimming pool for the Rohwer Center. With one exception, all of the swimming pools which have been estab- lished at the other relocation centers have been temporary exca- vations for wading for children or the diversion of irrigation water from one of the irrigation canals. The one exception is a concrete and brick pool at Poston III which was constructed at the time that center was operated by the Indian Service and was done so far as we know without WPB approval. WRA has also disapproved the construction of a concrete pool at the Granada center.
After discussion with Mr. Utz, it would appear that the problem of construction of a substantial pool at Rohwer would entail a good deal of fill in order to secure adequate drainage and that the supply of water for such a pool might constitute an undue drain, during the summer months, upon the domestic water supply at the center. In any event, we would not want to ap- prove such a project until we have had estimates and plans made and could submit them to WPB. In view also of the temporary nature of the centers, it seems extremely inadvisable to initiat construction of this sort at this time of the year unless, there fore, stronger justification than now appears can be submitted. The request is not approved.	
As of the same date as your letter, another has reached me from Mr. Chester Fujino, Chairman of the Council, urging strongly the approval of this project. Will you please ex- press to him my regrets that we feel unable to authorize such construction work at this time. Should same simple plan be able to be worked out for a small wading pool for the younger children, I could see no harm in going ahead with such work.
Sincerely yours,
/s/ John H. Provinse,
John H. Provinse, Chief Community Management Division

TO: Miss Alice Alger, Chairman Committee on Gifts
FROM: Nat R. Griswold
SUBJECT: Community Playground, Gift From 442nd Battalion
This will confirm our conversation and indicate additional thinking with reference to a continuing committee on a community playground. In as much as Mr. Finch and the boys of the 442nd Battalion already have decided on the nature of their gift to this center, it becomes our task at the center to execute for the best effect their wishes. This seems a job too large and long for our committee on gifts. Therefore, according to our conversation, a special committee on community playground seems to be an order.
As I think of it the following groups and individuals might well be named, or name individuals, to serve on such a committee: Landscape Department 1, P.T.A. 1 from each elementary organization, Mr. Kataoka from Social Welfare, Director of Community Activities, and a representative from the appointed personnel of the school. (Probably elementary school principal)
This matter is not closed and you should feel free to make suggestions. This holds also for Miss Cargile or other members of the Committee On Gifts.

Day Camping
Children of the Center between the ages of 9 - 14 will be given opportunities during the summer to go to the woods for a day of picnicing and games as a part of the summer activities program. The children wishing to go would need to register in Public Service Hall 32 the week prior to going. For the younger children parental consent is required. They will be accompanied by leaders who will direct games and nature study. PLAY Ground for the Children
The 442nd Combat Unit of Camp Shelby has made recently valuable gifts to Rohwer Center. They have presented furniture for the loung of the USO. In addition there has been already received considerable equipment for a central playground for the children. Additional equipment is expected soon. The donations include slides, see-saws, trapeze bars, rings, swings, and sand boxes.
The following committee has been designated for selecting a sight for the playground and for landscaping it: Mrs. Kataoka, block 6; Mrs. Niiya, block 13; Mr. T. Koizuni, block 14; Mrs. M. Ziegler; Mr. J. Ohara, block 24; Miss Lila Harrison, Dor. 2; Dr. Griswold.
The committee set at 4:00 P.M. yesterday afternoon to make plans for the children.

Summer School and Activities Program
At the meeting of the summer staff of schools and activities
Nat. R. Griswold, coordinator of summer programs, explained plans for the summer, including a description of work in English for adults, remedial work in Jr. and elementary schools, courses for credit in the high school, part-time work for students, and free activities program.
The free activities program starts Monday, May 29, and includes opportunities for olders as well as younger people. It is believed that older people will be especially attracted by the discussion of currant affairs and programs in music, arts and crafts. In the latter activities there will be opportunities to do weaving, tie-dying, as well as sketching and painting. "Everyone who is looking for something to do should come to us," said Dr. Griswold, "for we propose to furnish just that activity." Parties and Social Affairs for Young People
A committee under the chairmanship of Miss Erma Harris is planning to help the Jr. and Sr. High Schools young people throughout the Center to have a good time socially this summer. The center is to be divided into districts in each of which will be an active group of young people planning for evening affairs, the committee in getting a survey of the young people in the various blocks. This will be a part of the summer school and activities program.

Memorandum June 14, 1944
TO: Mr. Abe
FROM: Nat R. Griswold
SUBJECT: Permanent settings for the auditorium stage.
The auditorium stage is in the first place a part of the educational buildings. As such it must be equipped properly for programs of various kinds western in style and character.
Secondarily, the stage will be used for community purposes. As such, there will be need for settings and properties eastern in style and character.	
The two distinct styles of activities being carried on the stage makes it imperative that planning the exterior sets as well as the interior sets be done cooperatively by those who have responsibility for the various activities. Therefore, I am naming you, who are working with the Rohwer Players on western sets, to work with Mr. H. Fukami of block 39 and Mr. Higa- shiya of block 27 to plan both the permanent exterior equipment for stage and the movable permanent settings for the western type and the western type productions. As sson as is possible I would like this committee to re- port on a plan covering complete sets which will be needed. The other two members of the committee must be thoroughly acquainted with the whole plan, so our work can go along smoothly.

SUBJECT: New Playgrounds for the Younger Children
Mr. Griswold, Coordinator of Summer Educational Acti- vities, calls attention to parents that new playgrounds have been cleared in 2 shaded areas where children in the first four grades say go for directed play. The 1st area is al- ready cleared and is located south of Blocks 1 & 2, just over the wire fence. The 2nd area will be finished by Thursday, July 20th, and is in the extreme south end of the center, southwest of Block 8.

To:	Mr. Ito
Mr. Hatanaka
Report: On Conference with Representatives from Block Managers and Council
Subject: Possibilities of Swimming Pool
Present: Messers Ito, Hatanaka, Yasuda, and Hattori
These gentlemen raised the question of whether the materials promised for the concrete slabs in every block might be used for building one swim- ming pool. Their reasoning is as follows:
1.	It would take 6, 468 square feet of concrete to build a slab in each block--14' x 14'.
2.	A swimming pool—100' x 50' graduated from 8' to 1' deep could be built with 6,250 square feet of concrete.
3.	Since the construction will be tempo- rary, the work could be rough and devices for drain- age of pool would not have to be of the greatest convenience.
The committee had a number of plans for changing the water and maintaining sanitary condi- tions. They agreed to confer with concrete workers in reference to construction work. Mr. Griswold agreed to discuss sanitation problems with Mr. Lowe, sanitation officer. The former also agreed to ap- proach the matter with some of the WRA administrators It was agreed that what we do, should be done quickly

MEMORANDUM

To:	Mr. Rains
Subject: Workers for Clearing the Playground
According to instructions given to me and to Mr. Ikebasu this morning by you and Mr. Cole, we requested the cooperation of the block managers in using block workers far clearing the ground south and west of the new auditorium. They were very co- operative and will instruct the block workers to re- port to the auditorium tomorrow morning at 8:00 am. They will expect a supervisor from the Office of Mr. Cole.
One member of the assembled Block Managers expressed the view which seemed to be concurred in by the others as follows: the managers are happy to have the weeds cleared by block workers; however, they would like to be assured that the grading and plac- ing of equipment will be completed according to plan very soon; they do not wish winter to come before this work is completed.
So, it would appear that in case, we get the weeds cut quickly that we should got the play- ground ready for use in a reasonable time thereafter.
This will strengthen the confidence of the managers in the administration.

						Rohwer Center High School

						May 9, 1945






Mr. A. G. Thompson
Superintendent of Education
Rohwer Relocation Center
McGhee, Arkansas

Dear Mr. Thompson:

	Because of the closing of school on May 25, 
and of its being necessary for me to leave imme-
diately after that to join my husband who is now
to be stationed in this country instead of overseas,
I should like to tender my resignation as art teacher
In the Rohwer Relocation Center High School and
Junior High School effective at the close of work
hours on May 26, 1945.  At that time all my records
will be in, art materials checked and accounted for,
Etc.

	The experience since January 3, 1943 in the
Center schools has been rich, enlightening, and
invaluable to me.  I shall always cherish relocation
center memories and friendships. Thank you
for every consideration, courtesy, and help which
you have given me
						Sincerely,

Memorandum
March 6, 1945
To: Mr. Moulton, Chief of Community Management FROM: N.R. Griswold, Supervisor of Community Activities SUBJECT: Requisitioning materials to darken auditorium.
Today I requisitioned twill and wire necessary to darken the auditorium windows, in agreement with our conversation.
We plan to work out with the manager of the Coop Enter- prises, the making and haging of the curtains. It must be done, so the curtains can be easily opened and closed.  Mr. Tanaka has expressed willingness to cooperate.
Darkening the windows will greatly increase the useful- ness of the building. The operators of the movies can have additional showings without taking an additional night or afternoon. During the longer days ahead afternoon stage shows and programs will find the curtains useful.
Since on recent occasions we have seemed to oppose the program of the coop movies, I am glad to have this chance to show my true desire to make more effective that program and other services to the community.
cc-Mr. Thompson, Mr. Tanaka

The Community Activities Section of the WRA has secured khaki twill and the wire necessary for the 8 curtains of following dimensions:
195" x 88" with 1" hems
We will have the seamstresses under our section make the curtains.

We understand this is nowise changes the sche- dule for use of the auditorium. The curtains will en- able all evening activities to begin earlier during the summer. They maybe necessary also for certain types of afternoon programs, thus they will make the auditorium generally more useful.

nection with the visit of Mr. Faris. During the exhibit representa- tive pieces of every variety of art will be photographed by Mr. Faris for the Russell Sage foundation. The exhibit will include every kind of creative hand work, including, paintings, sculpture, carving, stage- craft, stone-polishing, kobu, hand-made furniture, embroidery, weaving, flower-arranging, tsunami, and ornamental writing.

MEMORANDUM

From: Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor community Activities
Subject: Meeting of the young fry, (8-15 yrs.), Thursday, September 6, 9:00 AM.
The chairman Mr. Griswold, discussed the use of the play ground during the past summer. Attention was called to the abuse made of the equipment, particularly during the last 24 hours: cro- quet wickets have disappeared; see-saws have been turned over; the equipment box has had holes torn in it; badminton net has been cut and broken; the tables have been broken down; the pool room and the rec. hall has been generally misused. No one of the group have any suggestion as to why these abuses were made nor of how they might be remedied. All of those present twelve over 8 years promised they would not misuse equipment. Regulations governing the rec. hall and the pool room were explained.
Further plans for the play ground were discussed after Mr. Griswold announced that there would be a show tonight if the pro- jector was received from the repair shop. It was agreed that the equipment of various games should be kept by the chairman of the vari- ous games. The young people would secure these by asking the com- mittee chairmen for them, signing for same, and returning same to committee chairmen. The person signing for the particular game will be responsible for returning the game. Provided the chairmen of the several games accept this arrangement the equipment will be placed in the hands of tbe following people: Mr. Bailey-croquet, Allison- badminton, Sears-Softball, Melton-horseshoes.
The subject of a badminton tournament to be played immedi- ately was received with mild enthusiam. However it was decided to undertake such a tournament. The young people suggested the following for judges: Griswold, Brewster, Mrs, Booth, Mrs. Medlock, Miss Best, Hudson. The badminton matches will be only official when one of the judges are present to call same. Prior to the matches the judges will
-2-
meet and agree on general rules. After the young people have signed to play, Mr. Brewster will be asked to assist at pairing the players. As fast as the time can be scheduled there after, the matches will be played until a champion is determined. Ten of those signed for the tournament; four others were listed as wishing to play, making the total of fourteen to be paired.

NOTICE TO THE OUTPOST
Community Activities section announces the opening of a hobby shop room for boys at 31-6-F.

All boys between the ages of 9 to 12 who are interested in Cub scouting will be free to use the room. The room will be open each afternoon from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
Boys may keep their collections, from snakes to stamps, in this room. They may do wood work, carving, sketching and painting at the room. Groups will learn Cub scouting skills.

OLDER NISEI CONFERENCE
A conference of, for, and by the older Nisei seems an excellent idea to me. The Nisei's personal future and the future of the Japanese-American group will be determined by the events of the next twelve to twenty-four months. Nisei must make some decisions themselves now. They must make decisions as to their purposes, as to their vocations, as to their residence, and as to relations to other organizations and groups. These decisions cannot wait. They cannot be made by someone else. They must not be left to accident or to circumstances. That the Niseis at Rohwer have planned this conference is a most hopeful sign. Such a conference is not only good, it may prove indispensable to a happy future.

August 15, 1944.

Analysis of C.A. Staff:

The Community Activities office has plenty of “community” but tragically little activity. With the exception of the two division heads, the head of clubs, the typists, and the poster-maker (plus, of course, your own hard-working self) the amount of idleness, relieved only by talk, reading, and similar time-killers is positively demoralizing.

It is not my intention to lay the blame in any particular place but to point out the waste involved, especially in the development of habits of laziness among the staff and in the loss of service to the community. If and when the two division heads relocate as they should, the inertia will probably jump to near 100%.

There seem to be two basic deficiencies which are involved in the total set-up. On the one-hand, the administrative burden is too great to be carried by the director, alone. He needs to be supplemented by someone who can work with the party-planners and other young work philosophy which all young people

-2-

in this country seem to lack. The do-it-yourself philosophy is disastrous to any leisure time program if it infects the staff. Only by long, patient work can this be changed to a “let’s do it together attitude.” The loss of Pop or Kaz to relocation would provide an added need to this one which is already present.

In the second place, Rohwer young people, after two years away from contact with the world at large, are becoming in-grown. Lacking the introduction of fresh ideas from without, the leisure time program has narrowed to dances and softball. Scouts are on the way to extinction. The Teen-Age Club is one notable exception to the lack of experiences in working together, and that only because it is in the organizing stage. Games, square dances, and a wide variety of other activities common to the outside are noticeably deficient inside. Here C.A. could be an aid to the success of relocation. 

But we have discovered this summer how difficult it is to introduce anything new at Rohwer. The exaggerated social inarticulateness of the young people, inherited from the cultural pattern of Japan plus the desire to be thoroughly American was at its heart a high degree of embarrassability. 

-3-

This means that only slow, patient work based on through understanding can succeed in introducing new things to the life of the young people.

At both these points I am convinced that there is a need for the addition of further appointed personnel to the C.A. staff. I think these might well be recent college graduates who have come up through the student Christian movement.

The worthwhileness of the experience for such persons as Margaret & myself is inestimable. But the value of such persons to the Center would be furthered by a more thorough orientation to evacuee life. Furth of all these are the attitudes and custom characteristic of any important group – the dominance of the men, the dominance of the men, the conflict of first and second generations, the effects of languages differences. Those things and many similar ones make the approach to community problems different from that required on the outside. The shyness of boys and girls toward each other is a factor that one should learn to take in to consideration but one might better realize from the beginning.

Then there are certain problems peculiar to Rohwer. WRA has fostered a block consciousness of unusual strengths. And out of this have grown gangs of boys 

-4-

and of girls that need to be taken into consideration. Rohwer psychology – that is what any outsider coming to work for C.A. needs to have drilled into him.

Here is one final reason why I would recommend the use of a young SCM’er or two. When I walk through the blocks, I am greeted with the words “Hakujin, are you hakujin?” (Caucasian) so see a while person is so unusual an event for the young children (2 to 5 years old) that all they can do is exclaim about it. To add a couple of 20-25 year old girls to the C.A. staff, of the SCM type who would have the lack of race prejudice which is so infrequent among the WRA personnel, would do at least a little more to break down the racial purity of the concentration of Japanese-ness. For the young evacuees, only a young Caucasian can do this effectively. 

As a postscript to the do-it-yourself problem, I may mention an example. With considerable effort, Mary Yamada and I persuaded Nellie Utsumi that it would be fine for her committee and more likely to bring a teen-age response if they would make the name contest posters themselves. But Yakura-san said no, he could

-5-

not afforded to let any one use his brushes & paints; they would use them up. This is the sort of perfectionism which constitutes a genuine obstacle to the growth of the imperfect young people.

One problem to which you need to give immediate attention to securing a hostess for the Teen-Age Club who could be ready to start work on the day the keys to the PS hall are turned over to the organizing committee and the sweeping & hammering begins.

Thanks for being such a swell person to work under.

August 17, 1944
Report: On Conference with Mr. Johnston
Subject: Possibility of the Swimming Pool
Present: Messers Hatanaka, Ito, Yasuda, Hattori and Griswold
Times August 17, 1944, 9:00 a.m.
The proposal of the representatives from the Community Council and the Block Managers was gone over carefully by Mr. Johnston. He expressed agree- ment on the matter of practicability of construction of a pool. In this connection one question needs to be answered, how often would the pool need to be drained and how would it be drained?
Two major obstacles for such an undertaking remains: first, can it be done without WPB approval, even though we use non-critical materials? Second, do we dare face the public disapproval of the con- struction of swimming pool in this center?
The meeting adjourned with the understanding that Mr. Johnston would send an air-mail personal letter to Mr. Provinse setting forth the issues in- volved and asking for an immediate opinion. In the meantime, the concrete slabs orginally planned for each block will not be constructed.

From - Nat R. Griswold, Supervisor of C. A.
In connection with Day Camping this summer we had three mess
hall tables out on the west bank of the Bayou just north of the
bridge this saide the farm. Our caming is over. The farm trucks come right by the camp site where the tables are.
Could you have your truck drivers load these tables as
they return empty from the farm? They should be delivered
to the mess hall In block 31.

By Moe Hasegawa
There will be no indoor basketball for the Center this winter.
The proposed $45,000 combination high school auditorium and gymnasium will not begin construction until late next summer, according to the Public Works division. The build- ing will not be completed until next fall.
But survey of the grounds are now under progress, and construction on the first building of the $100,000 Rohwer high school is ex- pected to begin soon,
According to plans the gymnasium roof will be semi-cylindrically shaped and the structure will cover an area 118 feet square. Extending from one side will be a wing, the Health Unit.
Within actual build- ing there will be three sections. One part forms the boys' side, comprising of a coach's office, and equipment, storage, rest room, shower and locker compartments. On the other side, lies the identical
girls' section.
In the middle portion is the playing floor with the stage on the extreme and opposite the entrance. Above the entrance is the projection room,
The hardwood basketball court will be 80 by 96 feet and will be 20 feet high. There will be space on each side for bleachers; no balcony will be erected. The seating capacity of the auditorium for stage shows will be about 2000.
The stage will be 40 1/2 by 22 foot wide. Dress- ing and storage rooms will be located on either side.
Now that the workers have passed the blue print stage into the actual construc- tion, the residents can, pre- pare for basketball in 1943.

“A PLACE CALLED ROHWER”
	
	The following remarks are in substance an address made at a Rotary Club luncheon in Little Rock, Arkansas, in May 1981.  The occasion was prompted by a television documentary entitled “ A Place Called Rohwer.”  In fact Rohwer was merely a place, one country store and a station on the railroad ten miles northeast of McGhee, a small town in southeast Arkansas until the United States Government through a wartime agency established a Relocation Camp there to detain nine thousand Americas of Japanese ancestry and their parents behind watch towers and barbed wire for three years.  This section of cut-over land was chosen for one of the ten such camp sites because the government owned the land.
	Nineteen years before the Pearl Harbor tragedy I was a teacher in Tokyo when earthquake and fire destroyed more than half of that great city and left almost two hundred thousand people dead and burned beyond recognition.  The people of Japan confronted this tragedy with such courageous stoicism that those who witnessed the loss and suffering were amazed.  Very soon another spirit was manifest.  This was a fear that the United States, whose Pacific fleet was not far away, would rush in and take their country.  However, almost as suddenly American relief ship began to arrive with food, clothing, blankets, and lumber.  Fears were gone and instead we heard:  “Thank you for what your country is doing.”  In fact the United States did more to relieve the distress, with these material gifts and seven million dollars in cash that all the other countries of the world.  The two ambassadors felt that now a more congenial spirit could be cemented across the Pacific.  But this hope received a chilling shock a few years later when the U.S. Congress enacted a law stating that no Japanese could obtain United States Citizenship.
	Then came the Pearl Harbor tragedy the destruction of many American ships and the death of many soldiers asleep that Sunday morning.  The response was anger, disgust, hatred but no panic, no uprising against any group.  Instead there was cooperation.  Martial law was declared and people cooperated in restoring normal life.  In California there was the same anger and sorrow but no panic.  The F.B.I. quickly had matters well in hand.  They had already listed the men of prominence who might be the leaders in any opposition to the prosecution of a war against Japan, young men who had recently returned from study in Japan, even ministers who had Japanese language classes in the churches.  General DeWitt ordered Japanese families living near the harbor to move inland.  There was no panic.  Life resumed quite normal procedures.  But this did not satisfy the professional racists.  What then?
	An organized group put pressure on west coast congressmen and the President to move the Japanese-Americans inland.  This was the organized expression of selfishness, racial hatred, and disregard of the nation’s need of complete unity in a time of war.  The first effort, parading as fear and patriotism, was to get an order to General DeWitt to compel the people of Japanese descent to move inland some ninety miles.  The citizens of that area naturally protested this threatened congestion of their communities.  Thus the matter was thrown back into the lap of the army.  The officials of this group knew how to construct barrack towns in which the people were to be placed.  Thus the War Relocation Authority was created.  While these barrack towns were under construction the evacuated people were forced to occupy race tracks, fair grounds, and city parks as temporary quarters though race track stables converted into apartments retained the odor left by the thorobreds (sic).  Even in these temporary quarters the people were surrounded by guards and mounted machine guns.
	The hurried construction of barrack cities for ninety thousand evacuees did provide employment for many people.  In addition to the locations where local opposition could be overcome or disregarded, mostly in the far west, there must be barracks for residence, school houses, a hospital, ten of them, heating plants, a water system, a sewer system, and then streets.   This was enormously expensive.  It would have been less expensive for the Federal Government to station at each Japanese American front door an Army Major General for three years than the taking from their shops, professions, and farms ninety thousand people without even accusing any of them of disloyalty or crime.  My part in all this began in California where I was able to lend some assistance to families needing places to store furniture or to assist a high school senior to go east to college where the school authorities had the courage to accept them. With the college students back east it was almost without exception a hearty welcome.
	But my major task and opportunity was a Civil Service appointment as one of the three Assistant Directors of the War Relocation Center at Rohwer, Arkansas.  There the barrack city required all the construction already referred to plus the fact that the square mile of land owned by the Federal Government was a cut-over timber land in a rich delta.  This barrack town was similar to the other nine.  Each had about forty blocks with a mess hall and a bath house and barracks with a room for a family and each room furnished with a cot and a blanket for each occupant.  This was the living room awaiting a wealthy Rotarian from Long Beach and other families of wealth and culture.  In one barrack room lived an exceptional lady with her parents.  This was Miss Kansuma who was at that time the only lady every to graduate from the famous Kokugoro School of Drama in Tokyo.  She owned in this barrack room the kimono which won first prize at the New York World’s Fair.  This priceless garment was a gift in recognition of her dramatic excellence and her contribution to cultural refinement.
	This evacuation threw a new problem into the lap of the army.  Sons of these evacuees were serving in the army and navy.  What should be done with them now that their families had been placed into virtual internment camps?  As I recall the situation it seems that each commanding general was free to deal with these young men under his command as he saw practical.  Some of these young men joined their families within wire enclosures.  Later they were recalled.  All this time the army wanted the draft restored.  In the meantime an unusual experiment was launched which was to form a battalion composed exclusively of American volunteers of Japanese descent.  The army asked for one thousand from Hawaii, many times that number volunteered immediately.  The response was quite the same from the War Relocation Centers. The unit known as the 442 Combat was trained at Camp Shelby, Mississippi.  Their conduct was admirable from the beginning.  Not one ever went AWOL.  They suffered heavily in combat in Italy, but as a result they became the most decorated battalion in all American military history.  Their loss was heavy.  Their sacrifices are marked by white marble slabs in foreign American cemeteries.  Thirty two of these casualties were volunteers from the two Relocation Centers in Arkansas.  The writer knew many of them and their families personally.
	In bringing these remarks to a close I want to deal with a matter of deep concern to the Americans of Japanese ancestry and their parents as well as a host of their friends.  The internees at Rohwer left in a sacred corner an acre consecrated as the burial place of a score of graves, children and adults who died while in that interment center.
	A skillful artist, a master workman with concrete, erected there a tall shaft bearing this inscription:  “May the people of Arkansas keep in sacred beauty this place where our loved ones sleep.”  As the Second World War came to a close the Rohwer group, joined by those from the Jerome, Arkansas Center which had closed, erected a large monument which bears the names of thirty two young men who went as volunteers to serve in the units fighting for liberty and justice in Europe and gave their lives there.  Each has a white slab as a grave marker in one of the military cemeteries abroad, but this monument is the only memorial dedicated to these brave young men who represent their families and comrades in that tragic war.  The concrete monuments are crumbling beyond repair, so there must be erected a marble shaft firmly established to stand through centuries as a sentinel and as a reminder by American citizens and to American citizens that never again shall young American citizens be asked to go abroad to die in defense of freedom and justice while their parents and sweethearts are kept without accusation of crime or disloyalty behind rifle towers and barbed wire.  Let this be a new Statue of Liberty.

						Joseph Boone Hunter

This is a Postscript

	The complete closing of the War Relocation Centers was inevitable and rapid after the Supreme Court decided that no American citizen could be so restrained after it was inevitable that no invasion of the United States was probable. This meant that the evacuees could go at will back to their homes or elsewhere. Funds were provided to whatever place in America each requested. A skeleton staff of the employed Civil Service remained.
	The section of land bore a sort of checkerboard appearance after the barracks and service buildings had been wrecked and sold with only the concrete floors remaining. The farmer who purchased the land disposed of the concrete floors by bulldozing them into huge ditches which were scooped out for their burying place. But the cemetery lot was left to grow up in new trees and weeds. The monuments were almost hidden from view by all this growth. This was the situation when I returned to Arkansas fifteen years after the Center was closed. I felt wounded inside. I asked the owner of the Center area and now a farmer to hire men to clean off the cemetery which was done immediately. I think it was Mr. Miki Nakamura who paid me back what the operation had cost.
	At this point a search was started to find a way to care for this sacred acre. A high school teacher and some of his students gave the place a work day occasionally. Lieutenant Governor Brett, a Legionnaire and a one arm veteran, was instrumental in getting this area one of the projects of “Green Thumb” a work project for idle farm labor. This service has continued. A few years ago a squad of Legionnaires from Chicago, all Americans of Japanese descent, came down and conducted a very formal dedication service which was especially for their comrades from this War Relocation Center whose names are inscribed on the larger monument erected here as a memorial.

Son, and internee, Tim Taira says, "Dad had permission early to leave the camp and to pursue a much more lucrative practice outside the camp.  He chose to stay in camp to service the evacuees at a paltry $19 a month.  He was among the first to arrive in Jerome, and the last to leave Rohwer.  Many of his patients expressed gratitude that he chose to stay behind in camp to serve them.  He always considered serving people as primary.  Definitely an old school doctor."
